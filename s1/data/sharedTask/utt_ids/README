When we do validation, we use these utterance_ids to split the data into train and test at the ratio of 9:1.
utt0_train and utt0_test contain utterance ids for train0 and test0 (validation exp0),
utt1_train and utt1_test contain utterance ids for train1 and test1 (validation exp1),
...
utt9_train and utt9_test contain utterance ids for train9 and test9 (validation exp9).
utt_all includes all the utterance ids in the shared task development set.
