The optional-silence phone sil occupies 27.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 18.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 88.7 hours of data, or 64.1 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 6.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (18,29.9,93)
