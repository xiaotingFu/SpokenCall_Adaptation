The optional-silence phone sil occupies 24.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 15.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 88.7 hours of data, or 67.3 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,27.2,90)
