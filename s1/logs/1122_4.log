step: 1
                        Step 1 : prepare data and extract features                       
Extract feature for training data
steps/make_mfcc.sh --nj 30 --cmd run.pl --mem 20G data/st_ihm_all/train data/st_ihm_all/train/log data/st_ihm_all/train/data
steps/make_mfcc.sh: moving data/st_ihm_all/train/feats.scp to data/st_ihm_all/train/.backup
steps/make_mfcc.sh [info]: segments file exists: using that.
Succeeded creating MFCC features for train
steps/compute_cmvn_stats.sh data/st_ihm_all/train data/st_ihm_all/train/log data/st_ihm_all/train/data
Succeeded creating CMVN stats for train
Extract feature for testing data
steps/make_mfcc.sh --nj 30 --cmd run.pl --mem 20G data/sharedTask2nd_test data/sharedTask2nd_test/log data/sharedTask2nd_test/data
steps/make_mfcc.sh: moving data/sharedTask2nd_test/feats.scp to data/sharedTask2nd_test/.backup
steps/make_mfcc.sh: [info]: no segments file exists: assuming wav.scp indexed by utterance.
Succeeded creating MFCC features for sharedTask2nd_test
steps/compute_cmvn_stats.sh data/sharedTask2nd_test data/sharedTask2nd_test/log data/sharedTask2nd_test/data
Succeeded creating CMVN stats for sharedTask2nd_test
Finished Feature extraction
