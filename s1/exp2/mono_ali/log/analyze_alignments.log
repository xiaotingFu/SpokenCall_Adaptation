The optional-silence phone sil occupies 29.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 19.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 88.7 hours of data, or 62.7 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (25,35.9,99)
