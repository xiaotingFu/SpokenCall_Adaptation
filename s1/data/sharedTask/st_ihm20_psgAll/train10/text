AMI_EN2001a_H01_FEO066_0052234_0052845 AND DEPENDING ON WHAT OUR UM ZOOM LEVEL IS WE JUST DISPLAY A PART OF IT
AMI_EN2001a_H01_FEO066_0053182_0053594 AND WE WOULD HAVE ONE VERY BIG THING OFF LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H01_FEO066_0053594_0053859 AND FROM THAT WE WOULD JUST SELECT WHAT WE ARE DISPLAYING

AMI_EN2001a_H02_FEO065_0488637_0488672 MM
AMI_EN2001a_H02_FEO065_0489118_0489972 BECAUSE IT'S QUITE EASY IN PERL AS WELL IT'S JUST A LINE OF CODE FOR COUNTING ALL THE WORDS AND YEAH IT'S IT'S BY HASHES
AMI_EN2001a_H02_FEO065_0490168_0490205 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H02_FEO065_0490503_0490527 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H02_FEO065_0491512_0491539 'KAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0001707_0001961 I I DRY READ IT THE LAST TIME
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0003878_0003940 NEXT WEEK
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0009375_0009423 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0010977_0011022 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0016034_0016072 NO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0022211_0022538 UH MINE'S GONNA BE MOSTLY USING THE OFF LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0022538_0022728 BUT THE ACTUAL STUFF IT'S DOING WILL BE ON LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0022728_0023221 BUT IT WON'T BE VERY UM PROCESSOR INTENSIVE OR MEMORY INTENSIVE I DON'T THINK
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0029486_0029552 DON'T THINK SO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0029733_0029764 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0031094_0031358 ARE WE STILL GONNA GO FOR DUMPING IT INTO A DATABASE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0031358_0031560 ARE WE STILL GONNA DUMP IT INTO A DATABASE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0032020_0032405 'CAUSE IF WE ARE I RECKON WE SHOULD ALL READ OUR CLASSES OUT OF THE DATABASE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0032405_0032529 IT'LL BE SO MUCH EASIER
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0032669_0033015 WELL IF WE'RE GONNA DUMP THE PART OF IT INTO A DATABASE ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0033015_0033618 WE MIGHT AS WELL DUMP ALL THE FIELDS WE WANT INTO THE DATABASE CALCULATE EVERYTHING FROM THERE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0033618_0034110 THEN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WORRY THAT MUCH ABOUT THE UNDERLYING X. M. L. REPRESENTATION
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0034110_0034202 WE CAN JUST QUERY IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0039366_0039887 WELL IF WE'RE GONNA DO THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND STORE EVERYTHING IN IN AN X. M. L. FORMAT AS WELL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0040119_0040152 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0040825_0040856 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0049453_0049889 WELL WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO DO THAT 'CAUSE IF WE GOT OUR INFORMATION DENSITY CALCULATED OFF LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0049889_0050247 SO ALL WE DO IS TREAT THE WHOLE LOT AS ONE MASSIVE DOCUMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0050247_0050912 I MEAN THEY'LL IT'S NOT GONNA BE SO BIG THAT WE CAN'T LOAD IN A INFORMATION DENSITY FOR EVERY UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0050912_0051079 AND WE CAN JUST SUMMARISE BASED ON THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0056786_0056925 I THINK YOU CAN DO IT ON LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0057891_0058716 I DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY MUCH POINT IN DOING LIKE THAT WHEN IT'S JUST GONNA FEED OFF IN THE END THE INFORMATION DENSITY MEASURE BASICALLY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0058716_0058885 AND THAT'S ALL CALCULATED OFF LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0058885_0059458 SO WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING IS SORTING A LIST IS THE P COMPUTATIONALLY HARD PART OF IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0059884_0060690 WELL LIKE THE IDEAS WE'RE CALCULATING ARE INFORMATION DENSITY ALL OFF LINE FIRST FOR EVERY UTTERANCE IN THE WHOLE CORPUS RIGHT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0060690_0061497 SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SAY IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SERIES OF MEETINGS YOU JUST SAY WELL OUR WHOLE DOCUMENT COMPRISES OF ALL THESE STUCK TOGETHER
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0061497_0062017 AND THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SORT THEM BY J INFORMATION DENSITY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0062017_0062382 LIKE MAYBE WEIGHTED WITH THE SEARCH TERMS AND THEN EXTRACT THEM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0062382_0062746 I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO SLOW TO DO ON LINE TO BE HONEST
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0063926_0063965 IS THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0065445_0065476 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0068569_0068829 WELL ON THE UTTERANCE LEVEL I WAS THINKING
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0068829_0069254 SO THE UTTERANCES WITH THE HIGHEST LIKE MEAN INFORMATION DENSITY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0069570_0069883 WELL THE TROUBLE WITH DOING IT ON THE WORD LEVEL IS IF YOU WANT THE AUDIO TO SYNCH UP
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0069883_0070238 YOU'VE GOT NO WAY OF GETTING IN AND EXTRACTING JUST THAT WORD
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0070238_0070325 I MEAN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0070589_0070782 FOR EVERY SINGLE WORD
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0070782_0070838 OH OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0071024_0071050 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0071395_0071549 I DON'T THINK THAT WILL DO IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0071549_0071640 WE'LL HAVE TO BUFFER IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0073408_0073626 WELL THE SKIMMING'S GONNA USE THE IMPORTANCE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0073845_0074084 BUT LIKE AT FIRST IT'S JUST GONNA BE I. D. F.
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0074502_0074630 WELL MOSTLY SKIMMING YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0077743_0077774 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0079221_0079563 WELL THE NICE THING ABOUT THAT IS IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE IN SENTENCES
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0079563_0079785 WELL MORE OR LESS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0079785_0080046 SO IT WILL MAKE MORE SENSE AND IF YOU GET JUST EXTRACT WORDS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0084650_0084684 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0087034_0087088 I SEE IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0087250_0088042 BUT IT'LL NEED TO BE CALCULATED AT WORD LEVEL THOUGH BECAUSE OTHERWISE THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH OCCURRENCES OF THE TERMS TO MAKE ANY MEANINGFUL SENSE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0088415_0088444 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0088974_0089228 YEAH I RECKON YOU CAN JUST MEAN IT OVER THE SENTENCE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0090192_0090335 I THINK WE SHOULD FILTER THEM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0091714_0091999 MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE UM A CUT OFF
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0091999_0092527 SO IT A W WORD ONLY GETS A VALUE IF IT'S ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0092527_0093049 SO ANYTHING THAT HAS LESS THAN SAY NOUGHT POINT FIVE IMPORTANCE GETS ASSIGNED TO ZERO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0093333_0093440 YEAH THAT'S THE OTHER TH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0093947_0093984 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0095821_0095998 I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO BUFFER THE AUDIO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0095998_0096167 BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE VERY HARD
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0096167_0096348 I THINK IT WOULD BE LIKE AN HOUR OR TWO'S WORK
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0096630_0097045 LIKE JUST BUILD AN ANOTHER F WAVE FILE ESSENTIALLY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0097179_0097414 YEAH I MEAN I BET THERE WOULD BE PACKAGES
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0097639_0097766 IN MEMORY YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0097766_0098250 SO JUST LIKE UNP THERE'S BOUND TO BE LIKE A MEDIA WAVE OBJECT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0098250_0098399 AND JUST BUILD ONE IN MEMORY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0098731_0098777 I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0098777_0098944 I HAVE NO IDEA
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0098944_0099297 BUT IT MUST HAVE LIKE CLASSES FOR DEALING WITH FILES
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0099297_0099721 AND IF IT HAS CLASSES FOR CONCATENATING FILES YOU CAN DO IT IN MEMORY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0099721_0099740 SO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0101660_0102614 WELL WHAT I THINK I MIGHT TRY AND BUILD IS BASICALLY A CLASS THAT YOU JUST FEED IT A LINKED LIST OF UM DIFFERENT WAVE FORMS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0102614_0103261 AND IT WILL JUST STRING THEM ALL TOGETHER WITH MAYBE I DON'T KNOW TENTH OF A SECOND SILENCE IN BETWEEN EACH ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0104116_0104228 NORMALISE IT YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0107283_0107415 OH YEAH YEAH WE'LL NEED THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0107621_0107910 WE ALSO REALLY WANNA BE ABLE TO SEARCH BY WHO'S SPEAKING AS WELL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0109242_0109529 IT DOESN'T MATTER 'CAUSE ALL THE CALCULATION'S DONE OFF LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0127833_0127892 THAT'S EASY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0127892_0128249 YOU JUST LIKE CREATE A NEW X. M. L. DOCUMENT IN MEMORY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0133618_0134351 I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE IF IT'S TOO BIG WHAT WE CAN DO IS JUST WELL ALL THE OFF LINE STUFF DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0134351_0134673 AND ALL WE CAN DO IS JUST PROCESS A BIT AT A TIME
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0134673_0135532 LIKE FOR SUMMARISATION SAY WE WANTED A HUNDRED UTTERANCES IN THE SUMMARY JUST LOOK AT THE MEETING TAKE THE TOP ONE HUNDRED UTTERANCES IN EACH OTHER MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0135532_0136099 IF IT SCORES HIGHER THAN THE ONES ALREADY IN THE SUMMARY SO FAR JUST REPLACE THEM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0136099_0136309 AND THEN YOU ONLY HAVE TO PROCESS ONE MEETING AT A TIME
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0138344_0139072 OKAY SO MAYBE WE SHOULD BUILD A B STORE A MEAN MEASURE FOR THE SEGMENTS AND MEETINGS AS WELL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0142298_0142500 AND SPEAKER

AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0174475_0174754 THE SEGMENTS ARE UTTERANCES AREN'T THEY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0174754_0174777 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0175055_0175131 ALRIGHT OKAY

AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0258234_0258565 UM WELL I'LL BE THERE FROM TWELVE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0258565_0259130 I'VE GOT SOME OTHER STUFF THAT NEEDS DONE ON MATLAB SO IF YOU'RE NOT THERE AT TWELVE I CAN JUST WORK ON THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0259130_0259144 SO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0259287_0259329 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0265027_0265071 WHY W

AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0288580_0288724 I'M JUST BUILDING A DICTIONARY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0289034_0289496 OH MINE'S JUST GONNA USE THE UM HASH MAP ONE IN UM JAVA
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0289496_0289725 'CAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA DO IT ON SMALL DOCUMENTS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0289725_0290180 IT'S JUST LIKE BEF UNTIL THE INFORMATION DENSITY IS UP AND RUNNING
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0290180_0290368 JUST SOMETHING TO GET GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WORK WITH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0290584_0290903 SO IT'S ONLY GONNA USE QUITE SMALL DOCUMENTS YOU SEE TO START WITH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0294403_0294736 WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE CLASSIFIED INTO LIKE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0295760_0296113 CAN WE JUST FILL A SECOND CLASS WITH JUNK THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0296353_0296603 LIKE I DON'T KNOW COPIES OF SHAKESPEARE OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0296955_0297545 'CAUSE IF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE UM FREQUENCY STATISTICS I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD BE CHANGED BY THE CLASSIFICATION
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0298486_0298558 I THE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0298828_0299012 WELL THERE MAYBE ANOTHER TOOL AVAILABLE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0299444_0299475 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0304560_0304830 UM I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO'S GOT IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0304830_0304947 MIGHT BE WORDNET
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0304947_0306137 BUT ONE OF THESE BIG CORPUSES HAS A LIST OF STOP WORDS THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD AND THEY'RE JUST BASICALLY LISTS OF REALLY UNINTERESTING BORING WORDS THAT WE COULD FILTER OUT BEFORE WE DO THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0306457_0306661 IT'S LIKE THAT'S ONE THE PAPERS I READ
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0306661_0307513 THAT'S UM ONE THINGS THEY DID RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING IS THEY'VE GOT THIS BIG S STOP LIST AND THEY JUST IGNORE ALL OF THOSE THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0309109_0309372 YEAH I IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR ME AS WELL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0309710_0310059 IT UH I THINK THAT'D BE USEFUL FOR ME AS WELL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0310059_0310095 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0310595_0310631 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0311547_0312168 WELL ALL YOU REALLY WANNA DO IS LOOK INTO GETTING SOME SUB SET OF THE ICSI CORPUS OFF THE DICE MACHINES
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0312168_0312309 'CAUSE I HATE WORKING ON DICE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0312309_0312379 IT'S AWFUL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0312551_0312728 LIKE SO I CAN USE MY HOME MACHINE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0313000_0313283 HA HAS A C. D. BURNER THOUGH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0313283_0313399 HAS A C. D. BURNER
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0314936_0315052 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0315052_0315220 THE RIGHT HAND CORNER FAR RIGHT

AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0317027_0317238 HOW BIG IS IT WITHOUT UM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0317452_0317670 THE WAV FILES AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0317812_0318369 'CAUSE I COULD JUST SAY AT UM GOING OVER S. C. P. ONE NIGHT AND JUST LEAVE IT GOING ALL NIGHT IF I HAD TO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0319290_0319815 IT'S YEAH I MEAN THE WAVE DATA ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT GONNA GET OFF THERE COMPLETELY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0320583_0320670 REALLY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0320670_0320720 OH RIGHT

AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0322097_0322345 I'VE GOT A LINUX BOX AND A WINDOWS BOX
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0322345_0322386 SO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0322556_0322604 BROAD BAND
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0322932_0323099 PUT IT ON TO C. D.
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0323099_0323310 I CAN IF I GET DOWN I CAN PUT TO C. D.
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0323471_0323505 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0324717_0324944 I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0324944_0325090 IS HOW MUCH DO WE GET
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0325402_0325496 REALLY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0325496_0325559 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0327248_0327483 YEAH BUT I CAN DO IT FROM THAT SESSION CAN'T I
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0327483_0327943 YOU CAN COMPRESS IT FROM A REMOTE SESSION AND S. C. P. IT FROM THE SAME SESSION
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0330026_0330074 DO YOU THINK
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0330585_0330689 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0330689_0331280 OH NO NO I WAS THINKING OF SSHING JUST INTO SOME MACHINE AND THEN JUST SCPING IT FROM THERE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0331713_0331751 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0331751_0331903 I MEAN IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE GATEWAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0331903_0331917 BUT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0332134_0332220 CAN YOU NOT DO THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0332832_0332894 MM I SEE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0333622_0333656 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0341914_0341971 SO YOU COULD JUST
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0342503_0342756 BUT TH FIRST UH HOW BIG ARE THE CHUNKS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0342917_0343095 HOW BIG ARE THE CHUNKS YOU'RE LOOKING AT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0344213_0344421 SO QUITE SMALL THEN
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0344421_0344970 SO YOU COULD JUST UM YOU COULD USE JUST THE SAME THING WE USED TO BUILD THE BIG DICTIONARY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0344970_0345708 YOU JUST DO THAT ON LINE 'CAUSE THAT WON'T TAKE LONG TO BUILD A LITTLE DICTIONARY THAT BIG WILL IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0345708_0346083 I MEAN JUST USE THE SAME TOOL THAT WE USE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0346083_0346105 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0346487_0346521 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0350090_0350212 IT DOESN'T NEED ORDERED NO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0351667_0352274 UM WELL THAT'S THE T ARE YOU USING T. F. I. D. F. FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0352845_0352939 ALRIGHT OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0353242_0353770 LIKE 'CAUSE FREQUENCY WOULD BE USEFUL I THINK
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0353770_0354792 BUT UM DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT THE SIZE AND WHAT WE CONSIDER A DOCUMENT IN THE SENSE OF CALCULATING T. F. I. D. F. IS GONNA CHANGE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0355046_0355219 WHICH MIGHT NEED THINKING ABOUT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0359903_0360060 I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0360239_0360740 WELL YOU NEED THE RAW FREQUENCY AS WELL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0360740_0360805 BUT UM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0360952_0361581 YOU ALSO NEED HOW MANY TIMES THINGS OCCUR WITHIN EACH DOCUMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0361734_0362273 AND UM WHAT WE CONSIDER A DOCUMENT'S GONNA DEPEND ON OUR CONTEXT I THINK
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0362273_0362939 'CAUSE IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE LOT OF MEETINGS WE'LL CONSIDER EACH MEETING A DOCUMENT IN SORT OF TERMS OF THIS ALGORITHM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0362939_0363862 AND IF WE'RE VIEWING LIKE SAY JUST A SMALL TOPIC SEGMENT YOU MIGHT LOOK AT EVEN EACH UTTERANCE AS A SMALL DOCUMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0365712_0365859 YEAH BUT THE THING IS UM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0366204_0366444 IT'S GONNA NEED SOME TH TH THOUGHT OF HOW WE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0366617_0366826 ACTUALLY MAYBE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0366826_0367304 MAYBE IF YOU JUST DO IT ONCE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT IT WILL BE FINE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0367304_0368111 BUT I WAS JUST THINKING IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE THE T. F. I. D. F. OFF LINE FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT LEVELS WE MIGHT WANT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0368111_0368920 'CAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA ALLOW DISJOINT SEGMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THEN HOW ARE WE GONNA KNOW WHAT'S GONNA BE IN CONTEXT AT ANY GIVEN TIME
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0368920_0369395 BUT I SUPPOSE IF YOU JUST DID IT GLOBALLY TREATING A MEETING AS A DOCUMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0369395_0370025 IT'D PROBABLY STILL BE WORK OUT FINE BECAUSE YOU'D ONLY BE COMPARING TO ONES WITHIN THE CONTEXT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0370973_0371258 UH I DON'T KNOW I THOUGHT WERE YOU GONNA USE THAT IN THE END
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0371540_0371671 THE INFORMATION DENSITY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0372940_0373031 OH SORRY THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0373031_0373731 LIKE UM YEAH FOR EACH WORD OR WHATEVER BUT ACROSS THE WHOLE LOT IS WHAT I MEAN BY HIGHEST LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0373731_0373857 LIKE ACROSS THE WHOLE CORPUS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0374673_0374929 YEAH BUT YOU'D PROBABLY LOOK AT EACH MEETING AS A DOCUMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0376642_0376734 MM POSSIBLY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0379442_0379705 ARE THEY BIG ENOUGH TO GET ANYTHING MEANINGFUL OUT OF
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0381421_0381578 WELL YEAH THAT IS NOT IT'S NOT AN ISSUE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0381578_0381827 YOU JUST CONCATENATE AN X. M. L. FILE TOGETHER
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0381827_0382265 BUT WE STILL WANT TO HAVE LIKE A NOTION OF MEETINGS FOR THE USER
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0383098_0383210 YEAH SURE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0383210_0383948 YEAH YOU JUST LIKE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO LOOK AT YOU JUST JAM TOGETHER INTO AN X. M. L. FILE AND THAT'S YOUR MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0383948_0384337 EVEN THOUGH BITS OF IT MAY COME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE OR WHATEVER
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0384337_0384803 I MEAN I DON'T SEE WHY THAT'S REALLY A BIG PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0385698_0386254 SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU CAN TAKE AN ARBITRARY AMOUNT OF DATA AND PROCESS IT WITH THE SAME ALGORITHM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0386254_0386626 IT DOESN'T MATTER CONCEPTUALLY WHAT THAT DATA IS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0386626_0386737 IT COULD BE A MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0386737_0386927 IT COULD BE TWO UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0386927_0387216 IT COULD BE A MEETING PLUS HALF A MEETING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0390471_0390610 I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THOUGH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0390610_0391338 I MEAN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST BUILD AN X. M. L. FILE AND IF YOU WANT IT TO GET DOWN TO THE UTTERANCES YOU'D GO TO THE LEAVES
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0391338_0391652 AND THEN IF YOU WANTED THE NEXT LEVEL UP
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0391652_0392676 YOU'D GO TO THE PARENTS OF THOSE AND LIKE JUST GO FROM LIKE THE LEAVES INWARDS TOWARDS THE BRANCH TO BUILD UP THINGS LIKE UM YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0392676_0393213 WHEN YOU CLICK ON A SEGMENT IT'S GONNA HAVE LIKE WORDS OR WHATEVER THAT ARE IMPORTANT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0393998_0394605 AS LONG AS LIKE THE ALGORITHMS ARE DESIGNED UM WITH IT IN MIND I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY BIG PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0394919_0395920 WELL LIKE SAY YOU HAD UM LIKE SAY FOR A MEETING RIGHT YOU'VE GOT LIKE UH SAY A HIERARCHY THAT LOOKS QUITE BIG LIKE THIS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0396184_0396419 AND LIKE THE UTTERANCES COME OFF OF HERE MAYBE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0396604_0397214 THEN WHEN WHATEVER YOUR ALGORITHM IS DOING AS LONG AS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH UTTERANCES YOU GO FOR ALL THE LEAVES
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0397214_0397829 LIKE THEN IF YOU NEED SOMETHING NEXT UP SO LIKE A TOPIC SEGMENT YOU'D GO TO HERE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0397829_0398181 BUT IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT SAY THIS ONE SO ONLY WENT LIKE THIS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0398518_0398948 RIGHT SO YOU IT'S SAME YOU'D START WITH THE LEAVES AND YOU GO OH I WANT A TOPIC SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0398948_0399048 SO I GO ONE LAYER UP
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0399216_0399833 SEE AND THEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH JUST A TOPIC SEGMENT IN THERE IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0399833_0400256 AND LIKE EACH TIME YOU WANT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU JUST NEED TO GO UP THE TREE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0400256_0400607 AND AS LONG AS YOUR ALGORITHM RESPECTS THAT THEN WE CAN JUST
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0400828_0401011 PROCESS ANY ARBITRARY X. M. L.
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0401147_0401387 FILE WITH WHATEVER HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE WE WANT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0401930_0402170 A MEETING SAY AND THAT WOULD BE A TOPIC SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0402992_0403797 SO I THINK AS LONG AS YOU BUILD AN ALGORITHM THAT RESPECTS WHATEVER STRUCTURE'S IN THE FILE RATHER THAN IMPOSING ITS OWN STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0404796_0404913 WELL NO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0405120_0405381 BUT I MEAN IT COULD BE AS MANY NODES AS YOU WANT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0405381_0405534 LIKE THIS ONE COULD BE DEEPER MAYBE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0405743_0405802 SAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0405802_0406582 SO THEN YOU'D START WITH ALL YOUR UTTERANCES HERE AND WHEN YOU GO UP TO GET TOPIC SEGMENTS YOU GO TO HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0406800_0407099 THAT MIGHT BE A BIT CONFUSING THOUGH 'CAUSE YOU HAVE THINGS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0410634_0410843 WELL WEDNESDAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0410843_0410884 YEAH

AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0411485_0412181 SO WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET LIKE A MINI BROWSER JUST DISPLAYS TWO THINGS SYNCHED TOGETHER OF SOME KIND
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0412181_0412299 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0412299_0412314 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0413368_0413430 IT'D BE USEFUL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0413430_0413599 I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU SEE ABOUT THAT THOUGH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0414992_0415103 I D HAVE NO IDEA
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0415396_0416113 I'VE PROBABLY GOT A REASONABLE AMOUNT BECAUSE UM EVERYTHING ON MY DICE ACCOUNT CAN ACTUALLY BE DELETED 'CAUSE I STORE IT ALL AT HOME AS WELL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0417282_0417420 IS THAT GUARANTEED TO STAY THE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0418321_0418496 MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEND A SUPPORT FORM

AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0420672_0421047 HAVING SAID THAT ARE WE ALLOWED TO TAKE A COPY OF THE ICSI CORPUS
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0421047_0421230 SOMETHING WE SHOULD PROBABLY ASK BEFORE WE DO IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0421701_0421753 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0423347_0423389 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0424527_0425014 NO ME NEITHER
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0441237_0441989 MIGHT BE FUNNY TO SEE WHAT IS SUMMARISED THE WHOLE CORPUS AS ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0441989_0442150 I THINK IT'D BE VERY USEFUL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0455372_0455482 WE CAN JUST CHANGE THE CODE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0473718_0473789 IS THAT IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0473789_0473855 THAT'S QUITE GOOD
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0478127_0478164 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0481691_0482308 I COULD JUST USE IT WITH THE FREQUENCY I THINK UNTIL THE INFORMATION DENSITY THING'S FINISHED
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0482308_0482418 THAT WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0492163_0492803 IF YOU'RE DOING IT IN JAVA COULD YOU UM SERIALIZE THE OUTPUT AS WELL AS WRITING IT TO A FILE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0492803_0493456 IF YOU'RE DOING IT IN JAVA COULD YOU SERIALIZE THE UM DICTIONARY YEAH AS WELL AS WRITING IT TO A FILE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0493625_0493752 IT'S REALLY EASY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0494191_0494399 I DON'T SEE WHY IT'D BE ANY MORE MASSIVE THAN THE FILE
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0494732_0494772 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0495116_0495335 IT JUST SAVES YOU PARSING THE UM
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0495546_0495671 FILE REPRESENTATION OF IT
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0495671_0495951 AND NOW 'CAUSE I WOULD BE USING IT IN JAVA ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0495951_0496174 SO I'D JUST BE BUILDING THE DATA STRUCTURE AGAIN
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0497185_0497672 YEAH BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A BIT SILLY TO BE PARSING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN KINDA THING
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0498725_0499449 I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT UM I THINK ALL THE COLLECTIONS AND THINGS IMPLEMENT SERIALIZABLE ALREADY
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0499718_0499825 I THINK THEY MIGHT DO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0501302_0502109 TONIGHT I'LL TRY AND UM I'LL EITHER WORK SOME MORE ON UH THE T. F. I. D. F. SUMMARIZER OR DO THE AUDIO THING
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0504214_0504258 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0504724_0504888 DO WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE SOMETHING NEXT WEEK
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0506718_0506755 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0509234_0509327 YEAH I KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0509829_0510797 I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE WE HAD TO SPECIFY IT OURSELVES THAT IT'S NOT AS UM LIKE FOCUS THE SPECIFICATION OF MOST UM WORK WE HAVE TO DO
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0511362_0511409 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H03_MEE067_0511546_0511950 ONCE WE START DOING IT IT WILL ALL BECOME MORE OR LESS OBVIOUS I THINK ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0000334_0000388 'KAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0000560_0000601 GOSH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0001048_0001088 'KAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0001677_0001805 IS THERE MUCH MORE IN IT THAN HE D
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0001901_0002077 IS THERE MUCH MORE IN IT THAN HE SAID YESTERDAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0002298_0002327 MM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0002508_0002702 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0002702_0002744 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0004683_0005624 YEAH NOW I'D SAY IF FOR THE PROTOTYPE IF WE JUST LIKE WHEREVER POSSIBLE P CHUNK IN THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE UM PRE ANNOTATED AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0005624_0005970 AND FOR THE STUFF THAT WE DON'T HAVE PRE ANNOTATED WRITE LIKE A STUPID BASELINE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0005970_0006441 THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO BASICALLY THAT MEANS WE FOCUS ON ON THE INTERFACE FIRST SORT OF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0006441_0007098 SO THAT WE WE TAKE THE THE READY MADE PARTS AND JUST SEE HOW WE GET THEM WORK TOGETHER IN THE INTERFACE THE WAY WE WANT AND AND THEN WE HAVE A WORKING PROTOTYPE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0007098_0007829 AND THEN WE CAN GO BACK AND REPLACE PIECES EITHER BY OUR OWN COMPONENTS OR BY MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPO PO COMPONENTS OF OUR OWN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0007829_0007991 SO IT'S PROBABLY FEASIBLE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0007991_0008261 THE THING IS I'M AWAY THIS WEEKEND
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0008261_0008508 SO THAT'S FOR ME
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0009323_0009394 OH YEAH UM YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0009394_0009419 NO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0009419_0010003 BUT ALSO I MIGHT LIKE THE THE SIMILARITY THING LIKE MY JUST MY MATRIX ITSELF FOR MY STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0010003_0010426 I C I I THINK I CAN DO THAT FAIRLY QUICKLY BECAUSE I HAVE THE ALGORITHMS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0010426_0011043 YEAH I THINK TODAY'S MEETING IS REALLY THE ONE WHERE WE WHERE WE SORT OF SETTLE DOWN THE DATA STRUCTURE AND AS SOON AS WE HAVE THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0011043_0011289 UH PROBABLY LIKE AFTER TODAY'S MEETING WE THEN ACTUALLY NEED TO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0011460_0012177 WELL GO BACK FIRST OF ALL AND LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. TO SEE IN HOW FAR THAT THAT WHICH WE WANT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THAT WHICH NITE X. M. L. OFFERS US
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0012177_0012665 AND THEN JUST SORT OF EVERYONE MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THE INTERFACE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0012911_0013629 SO I THINK IF TODAY WE DECIDE ON WHAT DATA WE WANNA HAVE NOW AND AND LATER MAYBE EVEN TODAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0013629_0013961 WE GO AND LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. OR SOME OF US LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. IN A BIT MORE DETAIL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0013961_0014534 JUST TRYING TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THAT CODE AND SEE HOW DOES THE REPRESENTATION WORK IN THEIR SYSTEM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0014534_0015141 AND THEN SORT OF WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO THEN SAY OKAY THAT TYPE OF NITE X. M. L. DATA WE WANNA LOAD INTO IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0015141_0015737 AND THIS IS HOW EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT AND THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO FROM THERE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0015979_0016024 NO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0016157_0017488 I'VE LOOKED LOOKED AT THE DOCUMENTATION AND N LIKE SEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK THAT WE WANT TO USE THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE A GOOD A EVENT MODEL THAT SYNCHRONIZES SORT OF THE DATA AND AND EVERY DISPLAY ELEMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0017488_0017761 SO THAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK AWAY FROM US
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0017761_0018162 SORT OF THAT WOULD BE A REASON FOR STAYING WITHIN THEIR FRAMEWORK AND USING THEIR GENERAL CLASSES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0018162_0018710 BUT BEYOND THAT I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT AT ALL WHICH IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY DO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0018710_0019626 WHO ACTUALLY LIKE FOR THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION I MEAN WHO OF US IS DOING STUFF THAT IS HAPPENING ON LINE AND WHO OF US IS DOING STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING OFF LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0019626_0019757 LIKE MY DATA IS COMING C
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0021058_0021074 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0021316_0021363 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0021842_0021886 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0022100_0022149 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0022897_0022930 'KAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0023174_0023651 SO BASICALLY APART FROM THE DISPLAY MODULE THE I THE DISPLAY ITSELF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0023651_0024471 WE DON'T HAVE AN EXTREMELY HIGH DEGREE OF INTERACTION BETWEEN SORT OF OUR MODULES THAT CREATE THE STUFF AND AND THE INTERFACE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0024471_0025049 SO THE INTERFACE IS MAINLY WHILE IT'S RUNNING JUST WORKING ON DATA THAT'S JUST LOADED FROM A FILE I GUESS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0025225_0025273 THERE ISN'T
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0025788_0025836 YEAH I KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0025836_0026585 TH YEAH THE SEARCH IS I GUESS THE SEARCH IS SORT OF A STRANGE BEAST ANYWAY BECAUSE FOR THE SEARCH WE'RE LEAVING THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0026585_0026933 UM BUT THAT'S STILL SORT OF THAT'S GOOD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0026933_0027825 THAT MEANS THAT AT LEAST LIKE WE DON'T HAVE THE TYPE OF SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY HAS TO DO LIKE A BILLION CALCULATIONS ON ON DATA ON LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0027825_0028518 'CAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE LIKE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT OUR INTERFACE FOR THE DATA WOULD HAVE TO BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW IT PERFORMS AND AND EVERYTHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0028518_0028968 AND NOBODY IS MODIFYING THAT DATA AT AT ON LINE TIME AT ALL IT SEEMS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0028968_0029312 NOBODY'S MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL DATA ON LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0029564_0029716 SO THAT'S ACTUALLY MAKING IT A LOT EASIER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0029716_0030029 THAT BASICALLY MEANS OUR BROWSER REALLY IS A VIEWER MOSTLY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0030029_0030614 WHICH ISN'T DOING MUCH WITH THE DATA EXCEPT FOR SORT OF SELECTING A PIECE PIECE OF IT AND AND DISPLAYING IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0031339_0031358 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0031612_0031886 WELL SOME PARTS RELEVANT FOR THE SEARCH YES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0031886_0031983 I'D SAY SO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0032583_0032608 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0034338_0034715 YEAH BUT NOBODY OF US IS DOING MUCH OF SEARCHING FROM THE DATA IN THE ON LINE STAGE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0034882_0035121 AND FOR ALL TOGETHER LIKE THE DISPLAY ITSELF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0035121_0035759 I THINK WE ARE EASIER IF WE IF IT'S SITTING ON THE X. M. L. THAN IF IT'S SITTING ON THE S. Q. L. STUFF BECAUSE IF IT'S SITTING ON THE X. M. L.
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0035759_0036968 WE HAVE THE THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK WITH ALL ITS FUNCTIONALITY FOR SYNCHRONIZING THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT LEVELS WHENEVER THERE'S A CHANGE WHENEVER SOMETHING'S MOVING FORWARD AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0036968_0037277 AND WE CAN JUST MORE OR LESS LOOK AT THEIR CODE LIKE HOW THEIR PLAYER MOVES FORWARD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0037277_0037573 AND HOW THAT MOVING FORWARD IS REPRESENTED IN DIFFERENT WINDOWS AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0037573_0038440 SO I THINK IN THE ACTUAL BROWSER ITSELF I DON'T WANNA SIT ON THE S. Q. L. IF WE CAN SIT ON THE X. M. L. BECAUSE SITTING ON THE X. M. L. WE HAVE ALL WE HAVE SO MUCH HELP
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0038440_0039285 AND FOR Y FOR LIKE THE P THE CALCULATIONS THAT WE'RE DOING APART FROM THE SEARCH IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE NEEDS SOME SPECIAL REPRESENTATIONS ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0040012_0040165 YOU MEAN OUR RESULTS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0040165_0040829 YEAH IN IN THE NITE X. M. L. X. M. L. FORMAT SO WITH THEIR TIME STAMPS AND STUFF SO THAT IT'S EASY TO TO TIE TOGETHER ST THINGS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0041168_0041711 WHAT I'M LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS IF WE GO WITH THIS MULTI LEVEL IDEA
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0041711_0042569 LIKE THIS IDEA THAT SORT OF IF YOU START WITH A WHOLE MEETING SERIES AS ONE ENTITY AS ONE THING THAT YOU DISPLAY AS ONE WHOLE SORT OF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0042569_0043255 THAT THEN THE INDIVIDUAL CHUNKS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WHEREAS AND THEN YOU CAN CLICK ON A MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0043255_0043779 AND THEN SORT OF THE MEETING IS THE WHOLE THING AND THE CHUNKS ARE THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0043779_0044242 THAT MEANS SORT OF WE HAVE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF OF REPRESENTATION WHICH WE PROBABLY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0044388_0044746 IF WE IF WE DO IT THIS WAY LIKE WE F WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT IF WE DO IT THIS WAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0044746_0044987 THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY FIND SOME ABSTRACTION MODEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0044987_0046015 SO THAT THE INTERFACE IN THE SENSE LIKE DEALS WITH IT AS IF IT'S SAME SO THAT THE INTERFACE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO WORRY WHETHER IT'S A MEETING IN THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES OR A SEGMENT WITHIN A MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0046015_0046186 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0046186_0046500 AND THAT'S PROBABLY STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OF LIKE PROCESS TWICE THEN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0046500_0047294 LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THAT LIKE THE SUMMARY OF A MEETING WITHIN THE WHOLE MEETING CORPUS OR MEETING SERIES Y IS MEETING SERIES A GOOD WORD FOR THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0047294_0047426 I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HOW TO CALL IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0047426_0048009 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE NOT NOT THE WHOLE CORPUS BUT EVERY MEETING THAT HAS TO DO WITH ONE TOPIC
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0048009_0048470 UM SO IN IN THE MEETING SE SERIES SO THAT A SUMMARY FOR A MEETING WITHIN THE MEETING SERIES ARE SORT OF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0048661_0048916 COMPILED OFF LINE BY A SUMMARY MODULE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0048916_0049376 AND THAT IS SEPARATE FROM A SUMMARY OF A SEGMENT WITHIN A MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0049376_0049466 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK WE CAN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0052921_0053066 SO ARE WE DOING THAT AT ALL LEVELS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0053066_0053152 ARE WE UM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0053867_0054209 AND JUST HAVE DIFFERENT LIKE FINE GRAINEDNESS LEVELS SORT OF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0054838_0054873 MM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0055179_0055233 'KAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0055233_0055966 SO THE ONLY THING THAT YEAH SO THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN BASICALLY IF I DOUBLE CLICK LET'S SAY FROM THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES ON A SINGLE MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0055966_0056164 IS THAT THE ZOOM LEVEL CHANGES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0056164_0056566 LIKE THE TH THE START AND THE END POSITION CHANGES AND THE ZOOM LEVEL CHANGES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0056809_0057041 I I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T DO THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0057041_0057400 LIKE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WE COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE COULDN'T LOAD THE DATA FOR ALL THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0057604_0057723 BUT I DON'T KNOW I MEAN THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0059647_0059865 SO I'M S NOT SURE IF I GOT IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0059865_0059903 I WAS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0060512_0060622 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0060622_0060687 MM-HMM

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0062077_0062113 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0062264_0062335 SO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0062669_0062809 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0062809_0063102 I WA I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE TOTAL MEMORY COMPLEXITY OF IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0063102_0063796 BUT I I COMPLETELY ADMIT I MEAN I JUST SORT OF LIKE TH TOOK THAT FROM SOME THING THAT JONATHAN ONCE SAID ABOUT NOT LOADING EVERYTHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0063796_0063925 BUT MAYBE I WAS JUST WRONG ABOUT IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0063925_0064019 HOW MANY UTTERANCES W
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0065185_0065436 YEAH AND I W YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0065436_0065590 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0065590_0065678 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0065678_0065763 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0065763_0066047 SO WHAT WE HAVE IS WE WOULD HAVE A WORD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0066232_0066569 LIKE WE WOULD HAVE WORDS WITH SOME PRIORITY LEVELS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0066569_0067627 AND THEY WOULD BASICALLY BE BECAUSE EVEN THE SELECTION WOULD WOULD THE SUMMARIES AUTOMATICALLY FEED FROM JUST HOW PRIORITIZED AN INDIVIDUAL WORD OR HOW INDIV UH PRIORITIZED AN INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCE IS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0067627_0068143 OR I ARE THE SUMMARIES SORT OF REFINED FROM IT AND MADE BY A MACHINE TO MAKE SENTENCES AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0068143_0068648 OR ARE THEY JUST SORT OF TAKING OUT THE WORDS WITH THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AND THEN THE WORDS OF THE SECOND HIGHEST PRIORITY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0068831_0068989 AND THE U OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0069206_0069395 ARE WE DOING IT ON TH THE WHOLE THING ON THE UTTERANCE LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0069395_0069670 OR ARE WE DOING IT ON WORD LEVEL LIKE THE INFORMATION DENSITY CALCULATION
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0070390_0070736 WE I THINK WE HAVE START AND END TIMES FOR WORDS ACTUALLY BUT IT'S YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0070736_0070973 BUT IT M IT MIGHT S BUT IT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY IN THE PLAYER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0070973_0071472 WE SHOULD REALLY MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT TOGETHER AT SOME POINT TODAY THAT WE CHECK OUT HOW THE PLAYER WORKS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0071472_0071820 BUT THERE'S MAYBE SOME MERIT IN ALTOGETHER DOING IT ON AN UTTERANCE LEVEL IN THE END
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0072033_0072054 SO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0073667_0073708 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0074675_0075085 WELL BUT ALSO ABOUT THE DISPLAYS I MEAN THE DISPLAYS IN THE IN THE TEXT BODY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0075085_0075553 IN THE IN THE LATEST DRAFT THAT WE HAD SORT OF WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT IT ISN'T DISPLAYING UTTERANCE FOR UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0075553_0076370 BUT IT'S ALSO DISPLAYING UH A SUMMARISED VERSION IN YOU KNOW LIKE BELOW THE BELOW THE GRAPH THE PART
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0076370_0076471 MAYBE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0076649_0076694 YEAH R
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0076858_0076876 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0076996_0077436 OH YEAH F IT'S JUST LIKE THERE THERE'S LIKE AUDIO SKIMMING AND THERE'S DISPLAYED SKIMMING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0077706_0077882 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0077882_0078504 MA MAYBE THERE'S SOME MERIT OF GOING ALTOGETHER FOR UTTERANCE LEVEL AND NOT EVEN BOTHER TO CALCULATE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT INTERNALLY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0078504_0078549 THEN YOU CAN DO IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0078549_0079271 BUT MAYBE LIKE NOT EVEN STORE THE IMPORTANCE LEVELS FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS AND JUST SORT OF RANK UTTERANCES AS A WHOLE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0079568_0079586 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0079724_0079775 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0079923_0080330 'CAUSE IT IT MIGHT BE BETTER SKIMMING AND LESS MEMORY REQUIRED AT THE SAME TIME
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0080330_0080723 AND I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS THEN YOU CAN JUST IN THE WORST CASE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0080723_0081057 IF YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE JUST SORT OF MAKE THE MEAN OF THE WORDS OVER THE UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0081057_0081113 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0081313_0081467 W IT'S IT'S
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0081686_0082248 WELL WHAT'S THE SMALLEST CHUNK AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE THINKING OF OF ASSIGNING AN IMPORTANCE MEASURE TO IS IT A WORD OR IS IT AN UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0082510_0082994 SO WE'RE THINKING OF LIKE MAYBE JUST STORING IT ON A PER UTTERANCE LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0083220_0083571 BECAUSE IT'S IT'S LESS STUFF TO STORE PROBABLY FOR DAVE IN THE IN THE AUDIO PLAYING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0083571_0083927 AND FOR IN THE DISPLAY IT'S PROBABLY BETTER IF YOU HAVE WHOLE UTTERANCES THAN I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0083927_0084374 LIKE WHAT IT'S LIKE IF YOU JUST TAKE SINGLE WORDS OUT OF UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0084374_0084912 THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL WHEREAS IF YOU JUST UH SHOW IMPORTANT UTTERANCES BUT THE UTTERANCE AS A WHOLE IT MAKES MORE SENSE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0084912_0085308 SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR YOUR ALGORITHM 'CAUSE IT JUST MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE WORKING ON A WORD LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0085308_0085600 THEN WE JUST MEAN IT OVER THE UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0086519_0086578 THEY ARE ON
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0086937_0087075 OH SO THAT'S GOOD ANYWAY THEN YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0087075_0087319 BECAUSE THAT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER THAN TO T PUT IT ON UTTERANCE LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0087958_0087994 OH YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0087994_0088294 NO BUT I MEAN LIKE HOW HOW JASMINE DOES IT INTERNALLY I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0088294_0088580 BUT IT'S PROBABLY YEAH YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK ON WORD LEVELS FOR IMPORTANCE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0088580_0089083 BUT THERE SHOULD BE WAYS OF EASILY GOING FROM A WORD LEVEL TO AN UTTERANCE LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0089083_0089117 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0090106_0090151 YEAH PROB
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0090658_0090688 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0093127_0093349 WELL WE DO A PRE FILTERING OF SORT OF THE WHOLE THING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0093349_0093712 SORT OF LIKE BUT THAT LIKE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IT'S EASY TO DO IN THE TEXT LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0093712_0094446 BUT THAT WOULD MEAN IT WOULD STILL PLAY THE UH IN YOUR AUDIO UNLESS WE SORT OF ALSO STORE WHAT PIECES WE CUT OUT FOR THE AUDIO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0094879_0094993 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0094993_0095433 I THINK BEFORE WE CAN LIKE ANSWER THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION HOW WE C DEAL WITH THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0095433_0095803 IT'S PROBABLY GOOD FOR US TO LOOK AT WHAT THE AUDIO PLAYER IS CAPABLE OF DOING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0096033_0096081 YES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0096447_0096554 SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BUFFERING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0096554_0096730 LIKE YOU THINK DIRECTLY FEEDING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0097129_0097681 BUT YEAH BUT NOT BUT NOT STORED ON THE HARD DISK AND THEN LOADED IN BUT LOADED IN DIRECTLY FROM MEMORY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0098261_0098896 BUT IT'S PROBABLY A STREAM IF IT EXISTS IN JAVA IT WOULD BE PROBABLY SOME BINARY STREAM GOING IN OF SOME TYPE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0098896_0098985 OKAY YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0099586_0099696 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0099696_0100150 OKAY SO I MEAN SO THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S PROBABLY EVEN IF YOU GO ON AN PER UTTERANCE LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0100150_0100741 THERE'S STILL SOME MERIT ON WITHIN UTTERANCES CUTTING OUT STUFF WHICH CLEARLY ISN'T RELEVANT AT ALL AND THAT MAYBE ALSO FOR THE AUDIO WE'D HAVE TO DO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0100741_0101536 SO LET'S SAY WE PLAY THE WHOLE AU PHRASE BUT THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT SAYS MINUS THAT PART OF SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0101536_0101650 THAT'S OKAY THAT WE CAN DO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0103214_0103633 YEAH MAYBE EVEN I MEAN THAT'S SORT OF THAT DEPENDS ON HOW HOW ADVANCED WE GET
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0103633_0104019 IF MAYBE IF WE REALISE THAT THERE'S MASSIVE DIFFERENCES IN IN GAIN OR IN SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0104019_0104613 YOU CAN PROBABLY JUST MAKE SOME SIMPLE SIMPLE NORMALIZATION BUT THAT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE AND AND HOW MUCH IS NECESSARY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0104613_0104958 YEAH IF LIKE I D I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AUDIO AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PLAYER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0104958_0105645 SO IF YOU FIND THAT THE PLAYER ACCEPTS SOME N INPUT FROM MEMORY AND IF IT'S EASY TO DO THEN I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S FAIRLY DOABLE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0105645_0105848 SO BUT THAT MEANS IN THE GENERAL STRUCTURE WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE LUCKY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0105848_0106916 SO WE WE HAVE WE LOAD INTO MEMORY FOR THE WHOLE SERIES OF MEETINGS JUST THE UTTERANCES AND RANKINGS FOR THE UTTERANCES AND SOME INFORMATION PROBABLY THAT SAYS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0106916_0107170 WELL THE I GUESS THAT GOES WITH THE UTTERANCE WHO'S SPEAKING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0107353_0107576 BECAUSE THEN WE CAN ALSO DO THE DISPLAY ABOUT WHO'S SPEAKING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0108020_0108063 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0108365_0109244 BUT I'M I'M STILL CONFUSED 'CAUSE I THOUGHT LIKE THAT'S JUST WHAT JONATHAN SAID WE DO C THAT WE CAN'T DO LIKE LOAD A MASSIVE DOCUMENT OF THAT SIZE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0109244_0109319 ON THE OTHER HAND
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0110014_0110547 THE OTHER HAND I MEAN IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE SHOULD BE LIKE FIFTY MEGA BYTE IN RAM OR SOMETHING IT SHOULDN'T BE MASSIVE SHOULD IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0110547_0110764 ACTUALLY FIFTY HUNDRED MEGABYTE IS QUITE BIG IN RAM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0111599_0111834 JUST THINKING WHAT'S THE SIMP SO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0112011_0112650 WE DO GET AN ERROR MESSAGE WITH THE PROJECT IF WE LOAD EVERYTHING INTO THE PROJECT WITH ALL THE DATA THEY LOAD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0112650_0112818 SO WE KNOW THAT DOESN'T WORK
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0112818_0113168 SO OUR HOPE IS ESSENTIALLY THAT WE LOAD LESS INTO IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0113168_0113483 WHAT'S THIS LAZY LOADING THING SOMEBODY EXPLAIN LAZY LOADING TO ME
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0114200_0114333 AH OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0114333_0114581 SO THAT IS THAT ONLY BY TYPE OF FILE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0114581_0115056 LIKE IF IF IF THE SAME THING IS IN DIFFERENT FILES WOULD IT THEN MAYBE LIKE YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0115056_0115633 IF IF UTTERANCES ARE SPLIT OVER THREE OR TEN OR W HUNDRED DIFFERENT FILES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0115633_0116009 IS THEN A CHANCE MAYBE THAT IT DOESN'T TRY TO LOAD THEM ALL INTO MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME BUT JUST
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0116340_0116507 SO WHY DOES IT FAIL THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0116507_0116733 THEN IT SHOULDN'T EVER FAIL BECAUSE THEN IT SHOULD NEVER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0116951_0117710 YEAH BUT YEAH BUT UM IT UH IT IT FAILED RIGHT WHEN YOU LOAD IT RIGHT THE NITE X. M. L. KIT SO THAT'S INTERESTING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0119247_0119290 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0120444_0120583 LET'S CHECK THAT OUT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0120583_0120926 UM I'LL P I'LL PROBABLY ASK JONATHAN ABOUT IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0120926_0121370 SO ALTERNATIVELY IF WE REALISE WE CAN'T DO THE WHOLE THING IN ONE GO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0121370_0121992 WE CAN PROBABLY JUST PROCESS SOME SORT OF META DATA YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE SORT OF SORT OF FOR THE WHOLE SERIES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0122159_0122574 CHUNKS REPRESENTING THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS OR SOME
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0122764_0123754 LIKE SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS THE WHOLE SERIES IN IN A V IN A STRUCTURE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH WE REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL UM MEETINGS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0123754_0124222 BUT WITH DATA SORT OF ALWAYS COMBINED FROM THE WHOLE SERIES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0124222_0125153 SO INSTEAD OF HAVING AN SINGLE UTTERANCE THAT WE DISPLAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LIKE THAT WOULD BE REPRESENTING A WHOLE UM TOPIC A SEGMENT IN A MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0125330_0125531 AND SORT OF SO THAT WI USING THE SAME DATA ST
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0126264_0126333 WELL IN A SENSE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0127218_0127804 UH I'M I'M THINKING OF IN A SENSE OF LIKE CREATING A VIRTUAL A VIRTUAL MEETING OUT OF THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES SORT OF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0128172_0128897 YEAH SORT OF LIKE OFF LINE CREATE A VIRTUAL MEETING WHICH WHICH BASICALLY TREATS THE MEETING SERIES AS IF IT WAS A MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0128897_0130026 AND TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITHIN THE SERIES AS IF THEY WERE SEGMENTS AND TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS WITHIN MEETINGS AS IF THEY WERE UM UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0130026_0130325 YOU KNOW SO WE JUST SORT OF WE SHIFT IT ONE LEVEL UP
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0130325_0130882 AND IN THAT WAY WE COULD PROBABLY USE THE SAME ALGORITHM AND JUST LIKE MAKE VIR LIKE ONE OR TWO IFS THAT SAY OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0130882_0131346 IF YOU ARE ON A WHOLE DOCUMENT UH A WHOLE SERIES LEVEL AND THAT WAS A DOUBLE CLICK
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0131346_0131976 THEN DON'T JUST GO INTO THAT UM SEGMENT BUT LOAD A NEW FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT BUT IN GENERAL USE THE SAME ALGORITHM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0131976_0132222 THAT WOULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE IF WE CAN'T ACTUALLY LOAD THE WHOLE THING AND
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0132480_0133236 'CAUSE ALSO LIKE EVEN IF WE MAYBE THIS WHOLE LIKE MAYBE I'M WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE WHOLE SERIES IN ONE THING DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0133236_0133618 BECAUSE ACTUALLY I MEAN PROBABLY USERS WOULDN'T VIEW THAT ONE TOO OFTEN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0136453_0136599 YEAH BUT I'M I'M STILL WORRIED
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0136599_0137220 LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE DISPLAY IF YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT A DISPLAY UH LIKE FOR THE WHOLE SERIES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0137220_0137825 THE INFORMATION DENSITY LEVELS BASED ON AND AND THE F AND THE ONLY GRANULARITY YOU HAVE IS INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0137825_0138410 THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE UTTERANCE IN A SERIES OF SEVENTY HOURS OF MEETINGS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0138935_0139102 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0139102_0139615 YEAH AND IF YOU MAKE THAT STRUCTURALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE THE LE LIKE ONE LEVEL DOWN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0139615_0139834 LIKE THE WAY HOW WE UH STORE INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0139834_0140209 THEN MAYBE WE CAN MORE OR LESS USE THE SAME CODE AND JUST MAKE A FEW IFS AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0140544_0140993 YEAH SO SO BUT STILL SO IN IN GENERAL WE'RE HAVING WE'RE HAVING UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0141169_0141314 AND THEY HAVE A SCORE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0141541_0141928 AND THAT'S AS MUCH AS WE REALLY NEED
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0141928_0142419 AND OF COU AND THEY ALSO HAVE A TIME A TIME INFORMATION OF COURSE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0142419_0142492 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0142492_0142685 AND A AND A S AND A SPEAKER INFORMATION YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0143079_0143300 YEAH SO AN INFORMATION WHICH TOPIC THEY'RE IN YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0143300_0143643 AND AND PROBABLY SEPARATE TO THAT AN INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TOPICS LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0143834_0143866 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0144018_0144100 SO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0144239_0144900 SO THE SKIMMING CAN WORK ON THAT BECAUSE THE SKIMMING JUST SORT OF SORTS THE UTTERANCES AND PUTS AS MANY IN AS IT NEEDS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0145423_0145515 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0145515_0146152 YEAH IT'LL IT'LL PLAY THEM IN SOME ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE SET BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S GONNA BE MORE ENTERTAINING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0146152_0146200 UM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0146361_0147114 BUT THAT THAT'S ENOUGH DATA FOR THE SKIMMING AND THE THE SEARCHING SO WHAT THE SEARCHING DOES IS THE SEARCHING LEAVES THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0147114_0148063 GOES TO THE S. Q. L. DATABASE AND GETS LIKE BASICALLY IN THE END GETS JUST A TIME MARKER FOR WHERE THAT IS LIKE THAT UTTERANCE THAT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0148063_0148671 AND THEN WE HAVE TO FIND I'M SURE THERE'S SOME WAY IN IN NITE X. M. L. TO JUST SAY SET POSITION TO THAT TIME MARK
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0148671_0149139 AND THEN IT SHIFTS THE WHOLE FRAME AND IT ALERTS EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF THE DISPLAY AND THE DISPLAY UPDATES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0149594_0149729 YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0149729_0150018 THAT WE CAN JU YEAH BUT SO SO IF IF SOMETHI SO YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0150018_0150263 SO IF IN THAT TREE DISPLAY SOMEBODY CLICKS ON SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0150519_0150946 YEAH AND THEN YOU SORT OF FEED THE TIME STAMP TO AND THE NITE X. M. L. CENTRAL MANAGER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0150946_0151518 AND THAT CENTRAL MANAGER ALERTS EVERYTHING THAT'S THERE LIKE ALERTS THE SKIM LIKE THE THE AUDIO DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0151518_0151624 ALERTS THE TEXT DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0151624_0152326 ALERTS THE VISUAL DISPLAY AND SAYS WE HAVE A NEW TIME FRAME AND THEN THEY ALL SORT OF DO THEIR UPDATE ROUTINES WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT LEVEL OF ZOOM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0152326_0152938 SO HOW MUCH DO THEY DISPLAY AND STARTING POSITION AT WHERE THE OR MAYBE THE MID POSITION OF IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0152938_0153515 I DON'T KNOW LIKE W IF START WHERE THE THING WAS FOUND OR IF THAT THING WA WAS FOUND IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PART THAT WE DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0153515_0153569 THAT I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0153569_0153775 BUT THAT WE CAN DECIDE ABOUT BUT A GENERAL SORT OF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0154010_0154584 IT'S THE SAME THING IF LIKE WHETHER YOU PLAY AND IT MOVES FORWARD OR WHETHER YOU JUMP TO A POSITION THROUGH SEARCH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0154584_0154957 IT'S ESSENTIALLY FOR ALL THE WINDOW HANDLING IT'S THE SAME EVENT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0154957_0155654 IT'S ONLY THAT THE EVENT GETS TRIGGERED BY THE SEARCH ROUTINE WHICH SORT OF PUSH THAT INTO NITE X. M. L. AND SAYS PLEASE GO THERE NOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0157742_0157937 WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO IT IN MEMORY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0157937_0158012 BUT THAT STUFF'S SO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0158269_0158502 I MEAN LIKE THE INFORMATION IS COMING FROM OFF LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0158831_0159339 SO WE PROBABLY WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CHANGE THE UTTERANCE DOCUMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0159339_0159765 RIGHT BECAUSE THE WHOLE WAY LIKE THE WHOLE BEAUTY OF THE NITE X. M. L. IS THAT IT TIES TOGETHER LOTS OF DIFFERENT FILES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0159765_0160373 SO WE CAN JUST CREATE AN ADDITIONAL X. M. L. FILE WHICH FOR EVERY UTTERANCE LIKE THE UTTERANCES HAVE I. D. S I PRESUME SOME REFERENCES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0160373_0160722 SO WE JUST WE TIE UH P JUST A VERY SHORT X. M. L. FILE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0160722_0161372 WHICH IT'S THE ONLY INFORMATION IT HAS THAT HAS WHATEVER A NUMBER FOR FOR THE UM WEIGHT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0161372_0161949 FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY AND WE JUST TIE THAT TO THE EXISTING UTTERANCES AND TIE THEM TO THE EXISTING SPEAKER CHANGES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0164681_0165696 WELL OTHERWISE WE PROBABLY HAVE TO GO OVER IT AND LIKE ADD SOME INTEGER THAT WE JUST INCREMENT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SORT OF TO EVERY UTTERANCE AS AN AS AN I. D. SOME TYPE

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0166371_0166524 IT'S ALM HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0167049_0167350 YEAH THE THE GIRL SAID THE UTTERANCES THEMSELVES ARE NOT NUMBERED AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0167587_0167727 OKAY

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0171237_0171757 THAT'S JUST SO LIKE TO MAKE A LIST OF ALL THIS STUFF OR WE PROBABLY CAN SOMEBODY CAN DO IT ON PAPER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0171941_0172087 ALL THESE FANCY PENS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0172087_0173107 SO WHAT SO THE STUFF WE HAVE WE HAVE UTTERANCES AND SPEAKERS AND WEIGHTS FOR UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0173107_0173726 SO FOR FOR EVERY UTTERANCE SORT OF LIKE THE UTTERANCE HAS A SPEAKER AND A WEIGHT WHICH IS COMING FROM OUTSIDE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0173726_0173942 OR WE JUST TIE IT TO IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0173942_0174440 AND THERE IS SEGMENTS WHICH HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0174736_0174869 OH SO SORRY UM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0174869_0175029 UH TOPIC S TOPIC SEGMENTS I MEANT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0175029_0175174 LIKE THEY ARE THEY ARE A SUPER UNIT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0175174_0175528 SO SO THE UTTERANCES ARE TIED TO TOPIC SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0176171_0176880 AND IF THE TIME STAMPS ARE ON A WORD LEVEL THEN WE B SOMEHOW HAVE TO EXTRACT TIME STAMPS FOR UTTERANCES WHERE THEY START
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0177437_0177578 W WHAT SEGMENTS NOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0178271_0178391 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0178391_0178891 IS THE UH IS THAT THE SAME AS UTTERANCES THAT IS THAT THE SAME AS UTTERANCES THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0179825_0179967 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0179967_0179996 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0181252_0181565 WHAT SO THAT'S OH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0181565_0181951 BUT THAT'S ONE O ONE SEGMENT OR IS THAT TWO SEGMENTS THEN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0182368_0182402 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0182700_0182824 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0182824_0182845 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0182845_0183574 SO BUT BUT GENERALLY UTTERANCES IS THAT WHICH WE JUST CALLED UH SORRY SEGMENTS IS THAT WHICH WE JUST CALLED UTTERANCES NOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0183574_0184006 LIKE IT'S IT'S THE SA IT'S SORT OF LIKE ONE PERSON'S CONTRIBUTION AT A TIME SORT OF THINGY DINGY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0184188_0184692 OKAY SO YEAH SO WE HAVE THOSE AND AND THEN WE HAVE SOME F FIELD SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH HAS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0184869_0184979 TOPICS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0185119_0185540 YEAH AND AND A TOPIC'S BASICALLY THEY ARE JUST ON THE I. D. PROBABLY WITH A START TIME OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0185540_0185939 AND AND THE UTTERANCES REFERENCED TO THOSE TOPICS I GUESS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0185939_0186403 SO THE TOPICS DON'T CONTAIN ANY REDUNDANT THING OF LIKE SHOWING THE WHOLE TOPIC AGAIN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0186403_0186827 BUT THEY JUST SORT OF SAY A NUMBER AND WHERE THEY START AND WHERE THEY FINISH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0186827_0187036 AND THE UTTERANCES THEN SAY WHICH TOPIC THEY BELONG TO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0188457_0188479 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0188479_0188509 NO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0188509_0188986 BUT I WAS THINKING OF THE TOPIC SEGMENTATION NOW AND AND F FOR THAT THERE WOULD ONLY BE ONE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0188986_0189200 RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF LIKE IT'S JUST A TIME WINDOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0189388_0189418 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0189602_0190423 SO IF THIS LAZY LOADING WORKS THEN THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY FIT INTO I MEAN NOT MEMORY THEN BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T ALL BE IN MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0190423_0191454 SO IF WE JUST HAVE THOSE SORT OF THAT INFORMATION LIKE A LONG LIST OF ALL THE UTTERANCES SLASH SEGMENTS AND LIKE SHORT OR SMALLER LISTS WHICH GIVE WEIGHT TO THEM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0191615_0192247 AND EVEN THOUGH PROBABLY IF THERE'S A LOT OF OVER HEAD IN HAVING TWO DIFFERENT FILES WE CAN PROBABLY MERGE THE WEIGHTS INTO IT OFF LINE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0192247_0192297 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0192297_0192925 LIKE IF IF THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRACY INVOLVED WITH HAVING TWO DIFFERENT TREES AND WHETHER ONE TIES TO THE OTHER BECAUSE THE ONE HAS THE WEIGHT FOR THE OTHER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0192925_0193128 THEN IT'S PROBABLY QUICKER TO JUST
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0194391_0194411 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0194411_0194948 I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WHOLE BEAUTY THAT LIKE YOU CAN JUST MAKE A NEW X. M. L. FILE AND SORT OF TIE THAT TO THE OTHER AND AND IT TRE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0195212_0195238 OH YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0195238_0195413 SO NO I DIDN'T I DIDN'T MEAN TREE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0195413_0195463 NO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0195463_0195483 NO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0195483_0195726 I MEANT JUST LIKE HANDLING TWO DIFFERENT FILES INTERNALLY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0195726_0196470 SORT OF C I WAS JUST THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE IF IF THE OVERHEAD FOR HAVING THE SAME AMOUNT OF DATA COMING FROM TWO D FILES INSTEAD OF FROM ONE FILE IS MASSIVE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0196621_0197363 THEN IT WOULD PROBABLY BE FOR US EASY TO JUST LIKE OFF LINE PUT THE THE WEIGHT INTO INTO THE FILE THAT HAS THE SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0197363_0197671 UH YEAH SEGMENTS SLASH UTTERANCES ALREADY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0197671_0198058 BUT THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT I MEAN IF IT'S GOING HORRENDOUSLY WRONG
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0198679_0198707 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0199029_0199141 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0199141_0199169 YEAH NO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0199169_0200207 WE'D WE'D BE COMPLETELY USING LIKE THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND BASICALLY JUST I MEAN THE MAIN DIFFERENCE REALLY BETWEEN OUR PROJECT AND THEIRS REALLY IS THAT WE LOAD A DIFFERENT PART OF THE DATA
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0200207_0200544 BUT OTHERWISE WE'RE DOING IT THE SAME WAY THAT THEY ARE DOING IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0200544_0200845 SO WE JUST WE'RE SORT OF RUNNING DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUERIES ON IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0200845_0201410 WE IN A SENSE WE I THINK WE ARE RUNNING QUERIES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT UM WHAT WE LOAD AND WHAT WE DON'T LOAD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0201410_0202004 BUT WE'RE L RUNNING QUERIES IN THE SENSE THAT WE DYNAMICALLY SELECT BY BY WEIGHTS DON'T WE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0202004_0202602 THAT WE HAVE TO CHECK HOW FAST THAT IS LIKE TO SAY GIVE US ALL THE ONES THAT WHETHER THAT WORKS WITH THEIR QUERY LANGUAGE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0202602_0202802 WHETHER THAT'S TOO MANY RESULTS AND WHETHER WE SHOU
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0203004_0203021 YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0203021_0203876 IF 'CAUSE IF IT I LET'S SAY I MEAN IF IF THEIR QUERY LANGUAGE IS STRANGE AND IF IT WOULD RETURN B TEN MILLION RESULTS AND IT CAN'T HANDLE IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0203876_0204334 THEN WE CAN JUST WRITE OUR INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS IN THE WAY THAT THEY KNOW WHICH WHAT THE THRESHOLD IS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0204334_0205007 SO THEY STILL GET ALL THE DATA AND JUST THEY INTERNALLY SAY OH NO THIS IS LESS THAN THREE AND I'M NOT GONNA DISPLAY IT OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0205417_0205436 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0205719_0205733 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0205733_0205916 NO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0205916_0206323 I'M JUST THINKING FOR THIS WHOLE THING OF LIKE A DIFFERENT LEVEL SORT OF CUTTING OUT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PIECES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0206323_0207167 WHETHER WE DO THAT THROUGH A QUERY WHERE WE SAY GIVE US EVERYTHING THAT'S AB ABOVE THIS AND THIS WEIGHT OR WHETHER WE SKIP THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0207167_0207742 BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL MODULE LIKE THE PLAYER AND THE DISPLAY SAY LIKE THEY STILL GET SORT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0207742_0208323 UH ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES BUT THEY SAY OH THIS PIECE I LEAVE OUT BECAUSE IT'S BELOW THE CURRENT THRESHOLD LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0210864_0211042 WHEN DO WE NEED THE ONE FOR THE MEET
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0211319_0211410 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0211410_0211792 YEAH I GUESS FOR THE SO WHEN WE HAVE THE DISPLAY WILL WE DISPLAY THE WHOLE SERIES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0211792_0212398 THEN IF WE HAVE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TOPIC SEGMENTS WITHIN THE MEETINGS IF WE HAVE READY CALCULATED DISP UM MEASURES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0212398_0212730 THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO SORT OF EXTRACT THAT DATA FROM THE INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0212730_0213069 YEAH AND THAT'S ALSO FAIRLY EASY TO STORE ALONG WITH OUR SEGMENTS ISN'T IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0213069_0213146 FOR THE SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0213146_0214454 ARE WE EXTRACTING SOME TYPE OF TITLE FOR THEM THAT WE CRAFT WITH SOME FANCY ALGORITHM OR MANUALLY OR WE'RE JUST TAKING THE SINGLE MOST HIGHLY VALUED KEY WORD UTTERANCE FOR THE SEGMENT HEADING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0215369_0215400 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0215805_0215898 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0215898_0217192 IT'S PROBABLY LIKE IN IN THE END PROBABLY IT WOULDN'T BE THE BEST THING IF IT'S JUST THE HIGH MOST HIGHLY RANKED PHRASE OR KEY WORD BECAUSE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR AN INTRODUCTION THAT WOULD MOST DEFINITELY NOT BE ANYTHING THAT HAS ANY TITLE ANYWHERE SIMILAR TO INTRODUCTION OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0217655_0217714 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0217942_0218466 ALSO LIKE FOR THIS PART MAYBE IF WE GO OVER IT WITH NAMED ENTITY IN THE END
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0218466_0218958 IF I MEAN W IF ONE OF THE PEOPLE DOING DIL HAS SOME NAMED ENTITY CODE TO SPARE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0218958_0219455 AND JUST LIKE AT LEAST FOR THE FOR SORT OF FOR FINDING TOPICS TITLES FOR FOR SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0219455_0219980 JUST TAKE A NAMED ENTITY WHICH HAS A REALLY HIGH WHAT'S IT CALLED D. F. I. D. F. WHATEVER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0219980_0220267 'CAUSE YOU'D PROBABLY BE QUITE LIKELY IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A CONFERENCE OR A PERSON
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0220267_0220785 THAT THAT WOULD BE A NAMED ENTITY WHICH IS VERY HIGHLY FR UM FREQUENTED IN THAT PART
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0221164_0221294 YEAH HE SAID THEY'RE QUITE SPARSE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0221294_0221719 SO THAT BASICALLY WAS DON'T BOTHER BASING TOO MUCH OF YOUR GENERAL CALCULATION ON IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0221719_0222565 BUT LIKE ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE SPARSE PROBABLY INDIVIDUAL NAMED ENTITIES WHICH DESCRIBE WHAT A WHAT A SEGMENT IS ABOUT WOULD PROBABLY BE QUITE GOOD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0222565_0223033 LIKE IF THERE'S SOME NAME OF SOME CONFERENCE THEY WOULD COULD PROBABLY SAY THAT NAME OF THE CONFERENCE QUITE OFTEN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0223033_0223475 EVEN THOUGH HE'S RIGHT THAT THEY MAKE INDIRECT REFERENCES TO IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0223475_0223607 ANYWAY SORRY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0225983_0226181 SO YOU'RE DOING THAT ON A ON A PER WORD LEVEL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0226384_0226432 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0226648_0226698 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0227446_0227546 OKAY COOL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0227546_0227744 I WAS JUST WONDERING WHERE YOU HAD THE CORPUS FROM AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0228234_0229573 SO IT IT SEEMS THAT THE DATA STRUCTURE ISN'T A BIG PROBLEM AND THAT BASICALLY WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ALL THESE MASSIVE DISCUSSIONS OF HOW WE EXACTLY INTERACT WITH THE DATA STRUCTURE BECAUSE MOST OF OUR WORK ISN'T DONE WITH THAT DATA STRUCTURE IN MEMORY IN THE BROWSER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0229573_0230381 BUT IT'S JUST DONE OFF LINE AND EVERYONE CAN HA REPRESENT IT ANYWAY THEY WANT AS LONG AS THEY SORT OF STORE IT IN A USEFUL X. M. L. REPRESENTATION IN THE END
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0230381_0230537 SO LIKE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0231258_0231735 YEAH THAT WOULD MEAN UNDERSTANDING THE NITE X. M. L. X. M. L. SORT OF FORMAT IN A LOT MORE DETAIL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0231735_0232342 WE SHOULD I THINK WE SHOULD JUST HAVE A LONG SESSION IN THE COMPUTER ROOM TOGETHER AND LIKE NOW THAT WE KNOW A BIT MORE WHAT WE WANT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0232342_0232637 TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT NITE X. M. L.
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0233238_0233267 MM-HMM

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0235525_0235619 GOOD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0235619_0235804 YEAH I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THIS STUFF MUCH AT ALL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0236216_0236251 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0236554_0236591 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0237181_0237998 WHO'S WHO'S SORT OF DOING THE THE THE CENTRAL COORDINATION OF OF OF THE BROWSER APPLICATION NOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0237998_0238046 LIKE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0238202_0238221 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0238356_0238989 YEAH OR BUT ALSO LIKE ALL THESE ELEMENTS LIKE LIKE THE LOADING AND YEAH INTEGRATION AND AND LIKE HANDLING THE DATA LOADING AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0239414_0239496 NAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0239496_0240215 I'M SORT OF LIKE I THINK I'LL TAKE OVER THE DISPLAY JUST BECAUSE I'VE STARTED WITH A BIT AND FOUND IT FOUND IT DOABLE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0240735_0241650 SO SOMEBODY SHOULD SORT OF BE THE ONE PERSON WHO'S WHO UNDERSTANDS MOST ABOUT WHAT'S T CENTRALLY GOING ON WITH WITH THE WITH THE PROJECT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0241650_0242021 LIKE WITH THE WITH THE BROWSER AS A WHOLE AND WHERE THE DATA COMES IN AND
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0242537_0242625 ANY VOLUNTEERS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0243061_0243198 IT'S ALSO A COMPLICATED ONE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0243376_0243423 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0243638_0243996 I KNOW BUT UH B I GUESS WE CAN DO IT LIKE SEVERAL PEOPLE TOGETHER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0243996_0244721 IT'S PROBABLY JUST THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER A LOT AND VERY CLOSELY AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS F UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OTHER ONE IS DOING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0245751_0246038 YEAH OR OR READY MADE VERSIONS OF THEM FOR THAT MATTER AND
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0246856_0247388 YEAH BUT I THINK ACTUALLY LIKE AT THE MOMENT THE INTEGRATION COMES FIRST I MEAN IT'S SORT OF AT THE MOMENT THE BUILDING THE BROWSER COMES FIRST
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0247388_0247779 AND THEN ONLY COMES THE CREATING NEW SOPHISTICATED DATA CHUNKS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0247779_0248289 BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF THE WHOLE THING ABOUT HAVING A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WHICH IS MORE OR LESS WORKING ON ON CHUNK DATA
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0248289_0248712 BUT IT AT LEAST WE HAVE THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH WE CAN THEN TEST EVERYTHING AND AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0248712_0248831 'CAUSE BEFORE WE HAVE THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0248831_0250042 IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO REALLY SEE HOW MUCH THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IS MAKING SENSE BECAUSE YOU JUST WELL I GUESS YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING FROM THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL X. M. L. S FILES FILES THAT YOU CREATE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0250042_0250407 BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME BASIC SYSTEM WHICH JUST DISPLAYS SOME STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0251475_0252056 OR JUST ADAPT LIKE THEIR LIKE JUST SORT OF GO FROM THEIR SYSTEM AND AND ADAPT THAT PIECE FOR PIECE AND SEE HOW WE COULD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0252248_0252480 HOW WE COULD ARRAN LIKE ADAPT IT TO OUR
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0252608_0252663 SYSTEM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0253106_0253637 DOES ANYONE WANT TO LIKE JUST SIT WITH ME AND LIKE PLAY FOR THREE HOURS WITH NITE X. M. L. AT SOME POINT

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0262613_0262730 SO IT'S NOT THAT CRUCIAL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0263929_0264078 YEAH ACTUALLY I NEED THE RAW TEXT AS WELL

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0264586_0264985 YEAH I THINK WE ALL NEED THE RAW TEXT IN DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS DON'T WE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0274512_0274707 BUT NUMBER WITHIN THE X. M. L. CONTEXT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0275384_0275512 ARE THEY SPOKEN NUMBERS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0275512_0275771 LIKE DO THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE UTTERANCES NUMBERS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0275771_0275931 THERE'S THE NUMBER TASK ISN'T THERE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0275931_0276084 THAT'S PART OF THE WHOLE THING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0276084_0276099 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0276253_0276306 OKAY

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0276933_0277232 YEAH WE HAVE TO PROBABLY CUT THAT OUT ANYWAY FOR OUR PROJECT I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0277232_0277578 IT'S PROBABLY GONNA SCREW UP A LOT OF OUR DATA OTHERWISE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0277578_0278977 IF NOT SURE IF IT WHAT IT DOES TO DOCUMENT IT WOULD PROBABLY MAKE THE YEAH IF IF YOU HAVE SEGMENTS FOR THAT PROBABLY THE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0279431_0279642 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0279642_0280012 UH I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IT PRO IT PRO PROBABLY LIKE THE L. S. A. WOULD PERFORM QUITE WELL ON IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0280012_0280797 IT WOULD PROBABLY FIND ANOTHER NUMBER TASK QUITE EASILY SEEING THAT IT'S A CONSTRAINED VOCABULARY WITH A HIGH CO OCCURRENCE OF THE SAME NINE WORDS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0280797_0281077 SO THAT WOU TEN WORD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0281077_0281098 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0281313_0281365 YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0281670_0281973 I THINK IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT THEY THEY SAID THE NUMBERS IN ORDER RIGHT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0282329_0282861 YEAH I THINK IT'S IT THE IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WANTED TO CHECK OUT HOW WELL THEY WERE DOING WITH OVERLAPPING AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0282861_0283446 BECAUSE BASICALLY IT'S LIKE THEY'RE READING THEM AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS BUT YOU KNOW IN WHICH ORDER THEY ARE SAID
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0283446_0283587 ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0283587_0283990 ICSI HAS SOME REASONS FOR DOING IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0283990_0284320 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN PISSED OFF SAYING LIKE NUMBERS AT THE END OF EVERY MEETING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0286289_0287285 UM DAVE IF YOU WOULD OR ACTUALLY FOR WELL IF YOU'RE DOING I. D. F. S OR YOU WHATEVER YOU CALL YOUR YOUR FREQUENCIES I ALWAYS MIX UP THE NAME
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0287285_0287602 UH YOU NEED SOME DICTIONARY FOR THAT AT SOME POINT THOUGH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0287602_0288480 LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME REPRESENTATION OF A WORD AS NOT NOT THAT SPECIFIC OCCURRENCE OF THAT WORD TOKEN BUT OF OF OF A GIVEN WORD FORM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0288480_0288760 BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING COUNTS FOR WORD FORMS RIGHT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0288760_0289018 YEAH SO WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THAT BECAUSE I NEED A DICTIONARY AS WELL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0289683_0289712 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0290021_0290039 'KAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0290420_0290469 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0290469_0290642 DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE O THE ORD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0290969_0291226 YEAH BUT FOR I'M JUST WONDERING FOR THE WHOLE THING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0291226_0291867 DOES SOMEBODY WO WHO WAS IT OF YOU TWO WHO SAID THAT UM THERE'S SOME PROGRAMME WHICH SPITS OUT A DICTIONARY PROBABLY WITH FREQUENCIES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0292445_0292554 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0292554_0293396 IS ANYONE OF YOU FOR THE FOR THE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY OVER TOTAL FREQUENCY YOU GONNA HAVE TOTAL FREQUENCIES OF WORDS THEN WITH THAT RIGHT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0293396_0293663 LIKE OVER THE WHOLE CORPUS SORT OF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0293663_0293688 OR
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0299716_0299878 W USING WHICH TOOL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0300138_0300238 BE CAREFUL WITH THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0300238_0301107 LIKE MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS WAS THAT THERE'S FAR MORE WORD TYPES THAN YOU EVER THINK BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT'S SORT OF UNUSUAL GENERALLY IS A NEW WORD TYPE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0301107_0301531 LIKE ANY TYPO OR ANY STRANGE THING WHERE THEY PUT TWO WORDS TOGETHER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0301531_0301727 AND ALSO ANY NUMBER AS A WORD TYPE OF ITS OWN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0301727_0302153 SO YOU CAN EASILY END UP WITH HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF WORDS WHEN YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THEM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0302153_0302534 SO GENERALLY DICTIONARIES CAN GROW BIGGER THEN YOU THINK THEY DO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0303057_0303735 WELL YOU CAN PROBABLY ALSO YOU CAN PROBABLY PRE FILTER LIKE WITH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS EVEN JUST SAY IF IT CONSISTS OF ONLY DIG DIGITS THEN SKIP IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0303735_0304005 OR EVEN IF IT CONSISTS ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0304005_0304468 THEN SKIP IT BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WITH A DOT IN BETWEEN WHICH IS USUALLY NOT SOMETHING YOU WANNA HAVE AND
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0307431_0308248 WHAT I DID FOR MY PROJECT I JUST IGNORED THE HUNDRED MOST FREQUENT WORDS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY END UP ALL BEING ARTICLES AND AND EVERYTHING AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0308673_0309019 SO WE NEED LIKE SEVERAL OF US NEED A DICTIONARY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0309019_0309209 AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS IT WITH FREQUENCIES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0309421_0309606 AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS IT WITH FREQUENCIES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0309606_0309629 OR
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0309972_0310130 FREQUENCIES

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0310161_0310337 WELL I GUESS AS SOON AS WE HAVE THE RAW TEXT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0310337_0310812 WE CAN PROBABLY JUST START WITH THE JAVA HASH MAP AND LIKE JUST HASH MAP OVER IT AND SEE HOW FAR WE GET
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0310812_0311294 I MEAN WE CAN PROBABLY ON A MACHINE WITH A FEW HUNDRED MEGABYTE RAM YOU CAN GO QUITE FAR
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0311294_0311388 YOU CAN WRITE IT ON BEEFY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0311388_0311626 SO EVEN IF IT GOES WRONG AND EVEN IF IT HAS A MILLION WORDS BE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0312811_0313358 OH YEAH BURNING IT ON A LIKE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BURN THE WHOLE CORPUS JUST THE X. HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0313358_0313659 AH I SEE I ASKED SUPPORT ABOUT THAT TWO DAYS AGO

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0315531_0315975 UM THE THING IS LIKE YOU CAN ONLY BURN FROM THE LOCAL FILE SYSTEM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0315975_0316349 SO IF IT'S FROM S WELL ACTUALLY I THINK IF IT'S MOUNTED YOU CAN DIRECTLY BURN FROM THERE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0316349_0316869 BUT THE PROBLEM IS I HAVE MY DATA ON BEEFY AND SO I HAVE TO GET IT INTO THE LOCAL TEMP DIRECTORY AND BURN IT FROM THERE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0316869_0316977 BUT YOU CAN BURN IT FROM THERE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0317413_0317752 UH WE LOOKED THAT UP AND I FOR WE LOOKED THAT UP AND I FORGOT

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0320223_0320715 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I FIGURED OUT I'M QUICKER DOWN LOADING OVER BROAD BAND INTO MY COMPUTER THAN USING THIS HARD DISK
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0320715_0321284 THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THE WAY HOW THEY ACCESS THE HARD DISK HOW THEY MOUNT IT WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0321864_0321936 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0321936_0322070 WHAT OPERATING SYSTEM DO YOU HAVE

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0324985_0325487 THE TEMP THE TEMPS USUALLY HAVE FOR GIGABYTE THREE OR TWO
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0325487_0325565 THE TEMPS YEAH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0325565_0325955 I DO LIKE I MEAN THERE'S NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANYTHING STAYS THERE BUT OVERNIGHT IT'LL STAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0325955_0326180 AND I THINK THE TEMPS USUALLY HAVE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0326618_0327236 AH YEAH BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE TEMP DIRECTORY OFF THE MACHINE YOU CAN S. S. H. INTO DIRECTORY OF S. S. H.

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0339398_0339933 I CAN PROBABLY JUST IMPLEMENT LIKE A FIVE LINE JAVA HASH TABLE FREQUENCY DICTIONARY BUILDER AND SEE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0340381_0340680 OH DID YOU NOT SAY FREQUENCIES F OF WORDS IN THE WHOLE SORRY DID UH
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0341997_0342089 SO YOU'D YOU

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0347672_0348599 SO ONCE I WRITE AN AR LIKE W IF I WRITE LIKE AN ALGORITHM WHICH DOES A HASH UM TABLE DICTIONARY WITH FREQUENCY FROM A RAW TEXT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0348599_0348777 THEN THE RAW TEXT CAN BE ANYTHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0348777_0349306 SO HOW FAR ARE WE G UH HOW F HOW FAR ARE YOU GETTING RAW TEXT OUT OF IT DO YOU THINK
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0349858_0350211 OKAY WELL THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE FOR THE DICTIONARY THE ORDER DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE DOES IT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0350211_0350903 SO YEAH SO UM I'LL GET THAT FROM YOU AND I'LL WRITE THE HASH TABLE WHICH GOES OVER THAT AND CREATES A DICTIONARY FILE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0350903_0351332 SO FOR THE DICTIONARY IS IT OKAY IF I DO WHATEVER WORD BLANK FREQUENCY OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0351332_0351656 JUST P COULD EVERYBODY SORT OF START FROM THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0351656_0351741 I MEAN I GUESS WE CAN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0353711_0353909 YEAH I I NEED FREQUENCY AS WELL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0355263_0356005 WELL I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WHAT WE CALCULATE BECAUSE I FOR MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS NEED LIKE COUNTS OF WORDS WITHIN A DOCUMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0356005_0356329 UH WITHIN A A SEGMENT ACTUALLY WITHIN A TOPIC SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0357213_0357446 CAN I CONVERT THESE PROBABILITIES BACK INTO FREQUENCIES
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0357897_0357956 OKAY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0358236_0358508 OH SO THAT'S WHAT F RAINBOW DOES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT L. S. A. BUILDS ON
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0358508_0358824 LIKE IT BUILDS A F A DOCUMENT BY FREQUENCY MATRIX
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0358824_0358908 SO I COULD PROBABLY GET THAT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0358908_0359202 EVEN THOUGH BUT I ALREADY HAVE I ALREADY HAVE MY CODE TO BUILD IT UP MYSELF
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0359202_0359256 NO DON'T BOTHER
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0359256_0359413 I HAVE MY CODE ALREADY

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0359675_0360277 YEAH SO DAVE YOU SAID YOU NEED THE FREQUENCY COUNTS ACTUALLY FOR PER DOCUMENT WOULD YOU SAY NOT FOR THE WHOLE THING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0363952_0365657 IT MORE AND MORE APPEARS TO ME THAT IF WE IF WE SCRAP THE NOTION OF THE MEETING AS AN INDIVIDUAL THING AND SORT OF JU SEE MEETINGS AS AS TOPIC SEGMENTS AND HAVE SORT OF LIKE HIERARCHICAL TOPIC SEGMENTATION INSTEAD
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0365657_0365856 THEN IT'S B LIKE A MORE COHERENT FRAMEWORK
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0369855_0370933 WAIT ARE WE ARE WE USING THIS UM FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE DO FOR THE WEIGHTING IN THE END NOW THIS THIS MEASURE YOU'RE CALCULATING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0372047_0372898 BECAUSE IF WE'RE DOING LIKE I THINK FOR FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY WE UH WE SHOULD CALCULATE IT ON THE LOWEST LEVEL NOT ON THE HIGHEST
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0372898_0372951 BUT LIKE 'CAUSE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0373912_0374497 YEAH BUT W IT DON'T YOU HAVE TO LIKE GO SORT OF LIKE FOR IN A DOCUMENT VERSUS THE WHOLE THING
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0374497_0374706 ISN'T THAT HOW IT WORKS THAT YOU C LOOK LOOK AT R
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0374973_0376175 I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE ISN'T IT LIKE THAT WE EXPECT TH THERE TO CHANGE OVER I B WITH THE DIFFERENT TOPIC SEGMENTS MORE
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0376175_0376422 THAT THEY TALK ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN EACH DIFFERENT TOPIC SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0377166_0377873 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT RELATIVE TERM FREQUENCY IS ABOUT THAT LIKE IN SOME CONTEXT THEY'RE TALKING MORE ABOUT A CERTAIN WORD THAN IN GENERAL
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0377873_0378121 SO THAT WOULD MORE BE THE THE TOPIC SEGMENTS THEN
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0378350_0378402 I DON'T KNOW

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0380400_0381446 SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S WAYS TO ABANDON THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF OF MEETINGS AND SORT OF BUT JUST NOT REALLY TREATING SEPARATE MEETINGS AS TOO MUCH OF A SEPARATE ENTITY
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0381446_0381469 BUT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0382608_0383179 BUT ON ALGORITHMIC LEVEL WHETHER WE ACTUALLY WHETHER THERE'S SOME WAY TO JUST REPRESENT MEETINGS AS AS TOPICS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0384224_0384272 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0384824_0384912 THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I MEANT
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0384912_0385108 BUT I THINK I HAVE TO THINK MORE ABOUT WHAT I MEANT

AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0388950_0389746 SO JUST THAT SORT OF TOPICS A HIERARCHICAL CONCEPT WHERE LIKE A TOPIC WHERE THERE CAN BE SUPER TOPICS AND TOPICS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0389746_0390428 AND THE SUPER TOPICS ARE IN THE END WHAT THE MEETINGS ARE BUT IN GENERAL AT SOME LEVEL SUPER TOPICS ARE TREATED LIKE LIKE TOPICS
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0393407_0393436 HMM
AMI_EN2001a_H04_MEO069_0393756_0394045 MM I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I WANT

AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0038485_0038821 I THINK IT WOULD BE CERTAINLY MORE THAN ONE WORD AND
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0038973_0039413 I THINK IT WOULD WORK BEST WITH UTTERANCES OR SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0042409_0043092 I THINK JUST THE SEGMENTS AS THEY'RE SEGMENTED IN THE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE POINT SE POINT SIX FIVE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0043849_0043910 I THINK SO
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0044404_0045377 AND YOU WOULD S PROBABLY STILL NEED UM YOUR VALUES FOR THE WORDS UM PERHAPS FOR FOR UM THE KEYWORDS THAT ARE DISPLAYED

AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0054147_0055425 OKAY SO HERE THERE'S FOR UM EACH SEGMENT UM UH THAT'S REALLY ALL SEGMENTS I MEAN IT'S IT CAN BE WORDS OR TOPICS OR UM ANYTHING I THINK
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0055632_0056460 UM THAT'S WHY TH IT'S FOR EXAMPLE TIME PROVENANCE DIALOGUE ACT OR TIME PROVENANCE SEGMENT OR TIME PROVENANCE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0057354_0057515 NO BUT IT YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0058336_0059001 YEAH IT P OH WELL SOME OF THEM POINT TO THE WORDS OTHER OTHERS POINT TO THE UM DIALOGUE ACTS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0059001_0059680 SO THAT'S KIND OF THE GLOBAL THING THAT TIES TOGETHER OTHER THINGS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0059965_0060008 UM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0060149_0060478 YEAH THEY HAVE THEIR NITE I. D. THE TIME
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0061157_0061605 THE SEGMENT IS WHAT IS DISPLAYED IN ONE LINE UM BY NITE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0062423_0063145 YEAH IT LOOKS UH UH THE SEGMENT THING LOOKS IN THE INTO THE WORDS X. M. L. FILE AND THE DIALOGUE ACTS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0063247_0063344 UM THING
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0063344_0063667 YEAH I THINK IT'S IN A DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0063849_0063886 UM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0064133_0064333 NO THEIR THEIR ANNOTATION OF DIALOGUE ACTS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0064333_0065391 AND ONE UM SEGMENT CAN HAVE OR ONE UM OF THOSE WORD STRINGS THAT ARE PRESENTED IN ONE LINE CAN HAVE SEVERAL UM DIALOGUE ACTS ANNOTATED ON IT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0065544_0065619 THAT'S WHY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0066817_0066910 YEAH IT'S FROM WORDS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0067149_0067182 YES
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0067781_0067913 THAT'S JUST BELOW
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0073039_0073795 BUT I THINK THESE SEGMENTS ARE PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST O ONE TYING ALL THE OTHERS TOGETHER
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0073949_0074545 AND THE INFORMATION OR R I MEAN WE ARE GOING TO CREATE A FILE THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE UM THE WORDS FILE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0074655_0074706 I THINK
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0078353_0078386 YES
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0079208_0079279 YEAH THEY ARE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0079896_0080366 UM TO DISCOURSE MARKER DIS F. MARKER FI POINT FIVE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0080538_0080810 YEAH THAT'S THERE NO NO UP UP
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0080810_0080926 GO UP
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0080926_0080965 YEAH RIGHT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0082292_0082453 YEAH THIS IS ALL THE SPEAKER D.

AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0084262_0084499 UM YOU CAN SEE WHETHER THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE OR NOT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0084499_0085490 YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE W UM W. POINT UM FIRST IT'S W. POINT UM FIVE UH FIFTY FOUR AND THEN IT'S SEVENTY SIX
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0085490_0085887 SO THERE ARE UM THIS NUMBER OF UTTERANCES OF OTHER SPEAKERS IN BETWEEN
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0087661_0087915 YEAH I THINK WE WOULD ALSO NEED TWO OF THOSE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0088112_0088824 YEAH I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE ONE THAT POINTS TO IT WHERE WE TIE TOGETHER ALL OUR INFORMATION
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0088824_0089296 SO WE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE TO MAKE ONE THAT'S SIMILAR
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0089745_0090354 YES AND UH THEN ANOTHER ONE THAT WOULD PERHAPS GIVE THE ACTUAL PROBABILITY VALUE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0090740_0091070 YEAH IT COULD COULD PROBABLY BE IN THE SAME FILE I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0091343_0091599 BUT IF YOU HAVE SEVERAL LAYERS THEN
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0091731_0091911 YOU CAN'T REPRESENT THEM ON THE SAME FILE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0094471_0094663 YEAH IN SEGMENT POINT ONE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0094663_0094780 UM THERE LINE BELOW
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0097879_0098165 YEAH THAT'S WHAT I MEANT ACTUALLY YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0100716_0100738 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0104261_0104331 UM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0105874_0106546 BUT I I MEAN THERE'S NOT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IS IN IN THE C CORPUS IN THERE IN THE SEGMENTS FILE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0106546_0107502 I THINK THAT IS JUST THE UM THINGS THAT ARE LOADED EVERY TIME BUT WE HAVE LAZY LOADING SO IT CAN LOAD MORE THAN THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0107502_0107801 PERHAPS WE COULD JUST TRY TO COPE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0107801_0107907 UM YOU KNOW TO
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0108013_0108313 MAKE OUR FILE ONE OF THOSE LAZY LOADED
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0108313_0108604 BUT I MEAN I'VE NO REAL IDEA HOW THAT WORKS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0109218_0109880 YEAH BUT YES BUT IT HAS UM YOU KNOW A BASIC THING THAT IT LOADS I THINK
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0109880_0110616 SO FOR EXAMPLE EVERY TIME IT LOADS THE SEGMENT THINGS IT CAN'T IT CAN'T NOT DISPLAY WORDS I THINK
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0110830_0110930 AND IT ERAS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0111242_0111291 I THINK SO
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0111441_0111541 THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTOOD IT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0111776_0112463 BECAUSE OTHERWISE IN THE IN THE OTHER THINGS THERE IS NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE PARTICIPANT NAME IS AND SO ON
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0112463_0112520 SO
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0112645_0113278 IN THE SEGMENTS FILE IT'S REALLY THE VERY BASIC THAT HAVE TO BE DISPLAYED FOR ANY THING
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0118752_0119424 YEAH I THIN I MEAN IT WOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT TO UM CREATE A FILE OF THE P SH OF THAT SHAPE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0119424_0119645 I MEAN THAT WOULD BE NO PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0121114_0121542 UM YEAH I I DON'T KNOW HOW ABOUT YOU WITH YOUR WORDS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0121542_0122289 BUT UM FOR MY SEGMENTS WERE THE UM F. ZERO MEASUREMENTS AND ALL THOSE VALUES I GET FROM THERE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0122289_0123328 UM I ALWAYS STORE THE BEG UH START AND END TIME OF EVERYTHING I CALCULATED THERE SO I WOULD JUST HAVE TO PU PUT IT UH YES
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0123793_0123865 YEAH IT IS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0125768_0126892 UH ACTU BUT ACTUALLY MY SEGMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME AS THEIR SEGMENTS BECAUSE AND THEIR SEGMENTS THERE ARE UM PAUSE UM PAUSES SOMETIMES
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0127130_0127770 UM YES BUT UH YEAH I MEAN ONE SEGMENT OF THEIRS IS SOMETIMES TWO SEGMENTS OF MINE THAT'S JUST WHAT I MEANT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0137010_0137572 YEAH BUT FOR EXAMPLE I MADE A FILE THAT CONTAINS JUST THE UM START TIMES
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0137572_0137913 IT COULD CONTAIN END TIMES AND WORDS FOR ALL SPEAKERS OF ALL MEETINGS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0137913_0138438 I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE SAME THING AS I GAVE YEAH AS I GAVE TO YOU
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0138438_0138978 BUT UM UH DISPLAYING ALSO A START AND END TIMES OF EVERY WORD
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0138978_0139582 SO YOU COULD PERHAPS USE IT TO MATCH UM IT WITH YOUR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU GOT COULDN'T YOU
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0139732_0139899 PERL A PERL SCRIPT YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0140130_0140171 NO NO
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0142608_0142629 MM YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0145755_0146234 BUT WOULD YOU THEN NOT GET THE TYPICAL WORDS FOR EVERY SPEAKER
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0146234_0146295 IF YOU
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0146727_0147115 BECAUSE IT WOULD THEN SAY HOW IT FIND THAT IT'S THAT SPEAKER
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0148160_0148192 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0148688_0148849 IT'S PROBABILITY YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0148849_0148990 OR OR VALUE YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0153037_0153316 SO COULD YOU PUT THE MORE INFORMATION BACK IN THEN
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0161372_0161595 YEAH BUT THE TOPIC ISN'T IT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0161595_0161722 THAT'S A TOPIC INFORMATION
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0172696_0172723 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0173167_0173185 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0174208_0174897 SO HOW SURE OR UNSURE YOU ARE ABOUT THE WHAT'S FOLLOWING OUR B OUR CONTEXT MEASURES YEAH

AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0178664_0179320 BUT DO WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMA ENOUGH DATA FOR THAT IT GIVES US SENSIBLE THINGS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0179320_0179894 BECAUSE I MEAN THE THE WORDS WE'RE LOOK REALLY LOOKING FOR APPEAR NOT TOO OFTEN
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0179894_0180514 AND IF THEY APPEAR FIVE TIMES IN THE MEETING AND THEY HAVE EACH TIME A DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0180514_0180920 YOU KNOW DIFFER SOME DIFFERENT SURROUNDED WORDS PERHAPS WE HAVE NOT ENOUGH DATA
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0182353_0182472 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU

AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0186881_0187611 BUT THAT WOULD GIVE THE SAME VALUE FOR ONE WORD EVERY TIME I MEAN FOR FOR A SPECIFIC WORD
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0187611_0188239 YEAH BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD BE QUITE EASY TO RE INTEGRATE IT INTO SUCH A
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0190628_0190977 OKAY BUT THEN IT WOULD ALSO BE POSSIBLE TO RE INTEGRATE IT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0190977_0191522 IT WOULD BE MORE DIF I MEAN IT WOULD BE A BIT MORE WORK BUT THEN
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0197872_0197913 YES
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0199387_0200176 UM AND WHAT WELL WHAT SCORE WOULD A WORD GET THAT JUST OCCURS ONCE IN ALL THE CORPUS FOR EXAMPLE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0200599_0201046 EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ALL THE OTHER SAME TOPICS WHERE IT DOESN'T OCCUR
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0202048_0202075 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0202529_0202979 SO WOULD IT BE HIGHER SCORED THAN A WORD THAT UM OCCURS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0203101_0203133 IN
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0203237_0203609 EVERY UM SEQUENCE OF THE SAME TOPIC
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0204074_0204471 YEAH I MEAN UM WE HAVE UH S UH OUR SEVERAL TOPICS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0204471_0205346 FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE TWENTY TOPICS AND UM FOR ONE OF THESE TOPICS THERE ARE FIVE OCCURRENCES AND WE HAVE ONE WORD THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0206226_0206744 YES BUT ACROSS MEETINGS UM THERE WILL BE THE SAME TOPIC SEVERAL TIMES
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0207148_0207204 AH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0207204_0207357 IT WASN OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0207357_0207548 I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE DOING
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0208269_0208343 YEAH BUT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0208532_0209034 YEAH BUT YOU MAKE ALSO UM SEGMENT SIMILARITY I THINK THAT WAS I I THOUGHT THAT WOULD
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0210559_0210976 AND THEY THEY ARE NOT RELATED THEN TO OTHER BLOCKS OF
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0211208_0211357 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0211357_0211413 I UM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0212161_0212216 OH OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0212325_0212454 I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT THEN
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0212812_0212983 SO YEAH HOW WOULD IT WORK
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0212983_0213102 I MEAN WHAT WOULD
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0213266_0213608 UM THE HIS INFORMATION THEN BE USEFUL FOR IN R RAINBOW
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0213728_0215065 UM I THOUGHT THE POINT ABOUT THAT WAS THAT WE WOULD PUT UM INTO S UM SERIAL CATEGORIES ALL THE SEGMENTS OF THE SAME TOPIC ACROSS MEETINGS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0215242_0215280 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0216812_0217013 YEAH BUT BUT THEN IT DOES OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0221196_0221230 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0224046_0224069 MM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0225227_0225255 MM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0227025_0227048 YEP
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0234282_0234334 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0234334_0234406 MM YEAH

AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0247759_0248442 YEAH I MEAN I HAVEN'T REALLY DECIDED ON UH HOW TO REALLY GET THE INFORMATION OUT OF THIS NOW
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0248442_0249314 BECAUSE UM WHEN I HAVE FOR EXAMPLE UM INCREASED SPEAKER OVERLAP THAT APPLIES TO SEVERAL TURNS OF COURSE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0249314_0250232 BUT I COULD GIVE UM THE INFORMATION ABOUT YEAH HOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0261969_0261990 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0261990_0263416 PROS UM BUT YOU PROPOSED UM WE WE SHOULD BREAK THAT DOWN TO HAVE UM THE SMALLEST UM SMALLEST UM UNITY UM OF TIME DURATION SHOULD BE ONE WORD
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0263416_0264063 I MEAN THAT WOULD BE BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE WHAT NATURALLY CAME OUT OF HER THING
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0264063_0264144 AND
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0264544_0265218 YEAH SURE BUT I COULD THEN IF I IF I HAVE UM THE VALUE FOR A SEGMENT I WOULD PERHAPS JUST GIVE ALL THE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0265391_0265731 IMPORTANT WOR OR MM YEAH NO
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0266261_0266298 YES
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0267226_0267254 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0267802_0268101 YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT SOMEONE HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN AYE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0268212_0268521 I WOULD PROBABLY SOMEHOW HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN TO TO THAT LEVEL YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0269046_0269105 YES SURE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0271192_0271481 YEAH PROBABLY SOMEHOW IT SHOULD WORK THAT WAY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0272624_0273384 YEAH BUT THEN OKAY BUT TH AT THAT MOMENT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO JUST MAKE IT ON A PER SEGMENT BASIS RIGHT WAY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0273384_0273661 AND LET HER ADAPT IT ALSO TO THE SEGMENT BASIS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0274420_0274446 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0274822_0275407 YEAH I MEAN MINE ARE ONLY MORE BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME START AND END POINT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0275407_0276151 SOMETIMES THEY'RE TWO SEGMENTS AND ONE WITH A GAP IN BETWEEN BUT UM THE HAVE UM TH TH THEY DON'T OVERLAP
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0276523_0276760 NO NO THEY DON'T BUT UM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0276937_0276972 UM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0277111_0277577 THEY'RE I MEAN MY SEGMENTS OVERLAP IN THE SAME WAY AS THEIRS DO
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0277577_0278767 BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE UM SPLIT ONE OF THE SEGMENTS INTO TWO SEGMENTS BUT IT'S EASY TO MATCH THE START AND END TIMES TO MAP IT TO THEIR SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0279133_0279269 I UH HOPE SO YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0284607_0284721 MM-HMM YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0284940_0285178 THAT WOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT BUT YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0287054_0287479 YEAH I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I'M ALREADY DOING WITH MY S UH SEPARATE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0290150_0290410 YEAH IT'S TELLS YOU EVEN WHICH WORDS IT IS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0300144_0300274 YEP
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0300274_0300402 SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0302458_0302485 YEP
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0303035_0303345 YEAH I HOPE TO HAVE SOME VALUE QUITE SOON
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0303345_0304790 BUT UM I JUST WORKED UM I MEAN I JUST CALCULATED THE VALUES VALUES FOR UM THE AVERAGE F. ZEROS AND UM THEY'RE WHAT'S C I MEAN I DIDN'T HAVE A LOOK AT THE DATA YET
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0304790_0305405 BUT UM THEY VARY QUITE WIDELY EVEN FOR THE SAME SPEAKER ACROSS MEETINGS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0305405_0306586 SO ONE SPEAKER HAD UM AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT A HUN ONE HUNDRED UM IN ONE MEETING AND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY IN ANOTHER MEETING THAT'S REALLY THAT'S STRANGE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0306586_0307198 I MEAN PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE OF LAUGHTER OR SOMETHING THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0307334_0307436 I'LL PROBABLY LOOK AT IT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0307984_0308433 YEAH THAT'S WHAT I READ IN ONE OF THOSE PAPERS UH AS WELL BUT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0308647_0308927 YEAH BUT IT COULD MESS UP THINGS QUITE CONSIDERABLY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0310466_0310526 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0310526_0310677 BUT UH AR YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0310677_0311088 BUT ALL THIS IS QUITE YOU KNOW DATA INTENSIVE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0311088_0311777 I WHEN I UM LET THE UM JUST CALCULATE THE AVERAGE F. ZERO LEVELS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0311777_0312532 IT I THINK IT NEEDED MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN WHAT HAVE HALF AN HOUR F TO DELAY IT FOR OUR MEETINGS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0312532_0313162 BECAUSE UM YEAH M I MEAN WE HAVE SEVENTY FIVE HOURS PER YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0313162_0313873 AV AVERAGE OF SIX SPEAKERS AND THEY'RE MEASURED EVERY O. POINT O. ONE SIX SECONDS
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0313873_0314158 AND THAT GIVES US QUITE A LOT OF VALUES
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0315383_0316380 YEAH WHAT I DID AT THE MOMENT IS UM I UM YEAH I GOT THE F. ZERO VALUES FROM FOR EACH SPEAKER FOR HIS HEADPHONE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0316380_0317173 AND I ONLY TAKE THOSE UM THE W UH THAT WERE RECORDED AT THE TIME WHERE HE WAS ACTUALLY SPEAKING
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0317173_0317590 AND FOR THOSE I CALCULATED UM THE AVERAGE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0317847_0317888 ZERO
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0317888_0318420 SO THAT GAVE ME UM NOW ONE VALUE PER SPEAKER PER MEETING
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0319481_0319642 NO NO THAT'S JUST THE AVERAGE
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0319642_0319818 NO THAT I YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0321060_0321763 YES I MEAN I R JUST UH NEEDED TO HAVE THIS VALUE NOW TO RELATE UM M HOW YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0322264_0322346 YEAH I THINK
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0322346_0322362 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0322818_0323122 UM AMUSEMENT AND SO ON IS YEAH

AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0323295_0323718 I I I MEAN IT I ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHAT CAUSES THESE UM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0323892_0324533 BECAUSE IT'S QUITE FUNNY TO HAVE A M MALE SPEAKING AT TWO HUN TWO HUNDRED UM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0324636_0324727 YEAH SURE BUT
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0335696_0335722 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0336083_0336983 YEAH AND I AM AT THE MOMENT FIDDLING AROUND WITH MY DATA AND NOT QUITE SEEING HOW I GET TO A SENSIBLE ABSTRACTION LEVEL YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0336983_0337249 FROM MY VERY
AMI_EN2001b_H00_FEO066_0339041_0339072 YEAH

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0004291_0004531 THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE JUST
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0004809_0004913 AH SOD THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0004913_0004935 OKAY THERE

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0013618_0015434 SO WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING IS MAYBE IF WE TRY TO REALLY MAKE SENSE TOGETHER OF THE X. M. L. FORMAT TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN ALL PRODUCE THE DATA THAT WE ARE PRODUCING IN A WAY OR AT LEAST I MEAN I GUESS MY DATA I'LL PROBABLY LOAD IN FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY ANYWAY BECAUSE IT'S MATRIX
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0015434_0015861 BUT ALL THIS STUFF THAT GOES WITH ANNOTATION THAT WE HAVE IT IN THE RIGHT FORMAT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0015861_0016353 MAYBE IF WE JUST SORT OF POOL WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE X. M. L. FORMAT AND TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF IT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0016353_0016658 I DON'T AT ALL KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT THIS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0016828_0017403 UM WHAT I DID JUST NOW IS I DOWNLOADED

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0018560_0019858 SOME X. M. L. FILES AND I WAS THINKING IF WE MAYBE JUST SHOULD GO THROUGH SOME OF THEM AND LIKE TRY TO SEE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL STRUCTURE AND POOL TOGETHER WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0019858_0020044 WHAT WE THINK THAT THINGS MEAN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0020044_0020969 AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW THE ANNOTATION FOR INFORMATION DENSITY AND STUFF SHOULD MAYBE BE STRUCTURED IN A SIMILAR WAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0020969_0021431 OR BUT I DON'T R I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN IDEA LIKE WHAT OTHER WORDS WHAT WE WOULD DO TODAY IN THIS MEETING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0021431_0021500 I MEAN

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0028182_0028623 IN SOME WAY LIKE I IN THE END IT'LL RESULT IN ONE ANNOTATION
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0028623_0029214 SO THE ONLY THING WE'RE TRYING TO TIE IN IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL ANNOTATION WHICH IS SIMILAR TO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0029368_0029764 THE ANNOTATION ABOUT WHAT WHAT WOULD IT BE S MOST SIMILAR TO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0029764_0030094 SIMPLY TO THE SEGMENTATION INFORMATION OR
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0030483_0030530 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0031000_0031389 I'M NOT SURE IT AH

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0057038_0057242 I MEAN THIS DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY CONTENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0057242_0057357 LIKE ANY TEXT

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0060501_0060827 NO BUT W LIKE UH SO THEY ARE THEY ARE SEGMENTS IN WHAT SENSE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0060827_0061022 WH WHAT'S DEFINITION OF A SEGMENT THEN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0061539_0061741 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0061741_0061772 AND
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0061907_0062419 AND THAT'S USUALLY DIALOGUE WHAT WHAT'S DIFFERENCE I BETWEEN PROVENANCE DIALOGUE ACT AND BETWEEN SEGMENTER
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0062419_0062461 I DON'T
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0063501_0063847 A DIALOGUE ACT UH A DIALOGUE ACT ANNOTATIONS OF DIALOGUE ACT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0063847_0064053 SO IS THAT JUST ANOTHER REPRESENTATION OF TEXT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0065867_0066053 JUST SEE CAN WE HAVE THIS FILES SOMEWHERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0066053_0066152 SO THE STUFF THAT'S
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0066330_0066642 THAT'S CALLED SEGMENT HERE THAT DO WE KNOW WHICH FILE THIS IS PULLING FROM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0066756_0067082 FROM YEAH IT'S IT'S C IT FROM WORDS X. M. L. IS THAT IT'S SAYING HERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0067317_0067620 LET ME SEE IF I HAVE THAT WORDS X. M. L. FILE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0067620_0067890 SO LET'S FOR EXAMPLE LOOK AT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0069449_0069758 OKAY LET ME JUST TRY TO GET THEM ALL TO A DIFFERENT SCREEN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0070114_0070304 UH UH IS THAT WHAT WE WERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0071147_0071656 SORRY I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO ARRANGE THEM SO THAT WE HAVE ONE ABOVE THE OTHER SO TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0072825_0072902 SO NO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0072902_0073044 HERE WE HAD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0074852_0075241 UM I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS SEGMENTS FILE IS ABOUT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0075241_0075600 LIKE IT'S IT'S REFERENCING HERE IT'S REFERENCING TO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0075886_0076263 TO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE IN THE WORDS FILE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0076842_0077123 SO IT'S THAT NON VOCAL SOUND ONE HERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0077123_0077288 THAT'S THE MIC NOISE OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0077496_0077953 BUT WHAT'S THE DOES IT ALWAYS JUST OH NO IT'S IT'S REFERENCING TO SEVERAL WORD STRUCTURES
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0077953_0078290 SO THIS WOULD BE BASICALLY BE A A SEQUENCE RIGHT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0078428_0078721 SO THAT'S FROM W. FIFTY TWO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0079020_0079660 ARE THEY NOT ORDERED OR OH YEAH FROM W. FIFTY TWO DOWN TO W. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0079660_0079821 AND YEAH W SORRY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0081215_0081268 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0081268_0081610 SO THIS SO THIS IS SOMEBODY SAYING IT IT DOESN'T
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0081717_0082215 DO WE HAVE ANY CONFIRMATION DO WE ACTUALLY SEE FROM THIS FILE WHO'S DOING IT JUST OUT OF INTEREST
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0082651_0082737 OH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0082737_0082911 SORRY IN SPEAKER D. 'S FILE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0082911_0083314 SO THIS IS WHERE HE'D LIKE TIME STOPS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0083314_0083785 AND THEN IT ONLY STARTS AT A LATER TIME BECAUSE OH YOU DON'T SEE WHEN I'M POINTING AT SCREEN IT'S JUST FOR THIS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0083785_0084118 SO THEN IT STARTS HERE THIS TIME AGAINST SPEAKER D. BECAUSE IN BETWEEN THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0084264_0084312 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0085585_0085720 YEAH

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0085960_0086576 SO THE THE FILE WITH ANNOTATIONS FOR INFORMATION DENSITY WHAT WOULD THAT BE LIKE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0086576_0087174 WOULD THAT BE LIKE THE SEGMENTS FILE GIVING A START WORD AND END WORD OR OR WOULD THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0087282_0087564 HOW WOULD THAT BE TO BEST TIE IN WITH THE SYSTEM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0088036_0088070 SORRY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0089065_0089724 SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR LIKE WHERE YOU GIVE SORT OF A REFERENCE TO A BEGINNING AND AN END POSITION
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0090460_0090617 WELL THAT WOULD BE IN THE SAME FILE WOULDN'T IT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0090617_0090913 IT WOULD JUST COULDN'T WE HAVE A LIKE UH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0091105_0091427 I GUESS WE COULD INTRODUCE A DIFFERENT UM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0092141_0092408 WE HAVE FOR NOW IF WE JUST DO SOMETHING WHICH FOR EVERY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0092549_0092952 SEGMENT IN HERE ATTACHES ACTUALLY CAN WE NOT TIE IT TO THE SEGMENTS FILE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0092952_0093280 WOULD THAT NOT BE THE WAY HOW THEY WOULD WANT IT TO HAVE TO DO AS IF WE IN THE END
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0093280_0093704 IF WE WANT TO ATTACH TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS ONE NUMBER FOR NOW
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0093812_0094141 AND THOSE SEGMENTS HAVE UH DO THEY HAVE AN I. D.
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0094141_0094303 YEAH I GUESS THEY DO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0094303_0094524 SO THIS IS THE I. D. OF A SPECIFIC SEGMENT RIGHT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0094903_0095618 YEAH SO WOULDN'T IT I MEAN THE PROBLEM IS THEY'VE ME HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE EXACT INNER WORKINGS OF THEIR OF THEIR ENGINEERED
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0095618_0096099 BUT YOU'D THINK THAT THE EASIEST WAY AND THE WAY THAT HOW IT'S INTENDED TO BE WOULD BE JUST
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0096221_0096593 IF WE HAVE HERE A LINK TO THE SEGMENT A LIKE AN I. D. FOR THAT SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0096593_0097346 THAT WE JUST CREATE ANOTHER FILE WHICH LINKS TO THE SEGMENT AND THEN HAS AN ADDITIONAL VALUE WHICH IS THE NUMBER
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0097775_0097850 YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0098082_0098339 YEAH OH SORRY I I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVING TWO FILES
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0098552_0098790 I WAS THINK YEAH I I THINK THAT I I UNDERSTOOD WRONG
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0098790_0099317 I THOUGHT YOU WERE WANTING TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT X. M. L. FILES WITH ONE THE REFERENCE AND ONE JUST TH JUST THE NUMBER
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0099317_0100225 AND I WAS THINKING THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT YOU MEANT JUST UM HAVING LIKE FOR EACH SORT OF OF OUR SEGMENTS HAVING JUST THE I. D.
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0100225_0100683 WHICH IS REFERENCING TO THESE SEGMENTS HERE AND ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE WHICH IS THE THE VALUE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0100874_0101262 SO THIS WHOLE INFORMATION WE WOULD THEN STORE IN THIS AH NO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0101262_0102268 THAT I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BECAUSE I DIDN'T DOWNLOAD LIKE THERE'S THIS ONE META INFORMATION FILE WHERE IT DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE OF ALL THE FILES AND DESCRIBES WHICH UM WHICH ATTRIBUTES THEY BRING IN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0102268_0102430 SO WE WOULD ADD THAT TO THAT FILE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0102690_0103023 SAYING THAT SORT OF WE BRING IN INFORMATION DENSITY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0103023_0103615 AND THEN WE WOULD CREATE THE FILE OF THAT TYPE WHICH WE PROBABLY COULDN'T CALL IT SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0103615_0103648 I'M NOT SURE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0103648_0103811 WE PROBABLY MIGHT HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT WORD FOR IT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0103811_0104122 I'M NOT SURE IF IT THERE'S ANY TROUBLE WITH IT REPEATING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0104900_0105032 IN THE EXISTING SEGMENTS FILE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0105645_0105856 YEAH I RECKON ACTUALLY IF WE MAKE A COPY OF IT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0108670_0109103 WHAT UH WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT THE W I TH DOESN'T THE LAZY LOADING APPLY TO EVERYTHING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0109103_0109268 I MEAN THAT IT SORT OF DYNAMICALLY LOADS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0110817_0111154 YOU THINK IT I IT L IT LOADS THE WHOLE OF THE SEGMENTS FILE EVERY TIME
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0111444_0111461 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0111634_0111848 THE SEGMENT AT THE MOMENT IS SPLIT UP OVER
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0113372_0113408 HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0116154_0116502 NO BUT I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO REALLY LIKE DISCUSS THAT IN DETAIL
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0116502_0117016 BECAUSE WE DON'T AT ALL UNDERSTAND AT THE MOMENT HOW THE INTERNAL DATA STRUCTURE LIKE HOW THE LOADING WORKS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0117016_0117288 SO MAYBE IF WE G IF WE GO AHEAD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0117288_0118083 DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO AN LIKE SOMETHING LIKE SEGMENTS OR MAYBE JUST A COPY OF SEGMENT WHICH HAS AN ATTRIBUTE FOR FOR EACH SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0118083_0118527 UM BUT IT IS LIKE WITH A WITH A VALUE WITH A DENSITY VALUE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0119621_0120056 WOULD IT BE EASIER THOUGH BECAUSE ALL YOUR METHODS ARE SORT OF NOT WORKING WITH THEIR WHOLE TIME FRAME STRUCTURE THERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0120056_0120326 SO WOULD IT BE EASY FOR YOU TO TO TIE THE THINGS TOGETHER
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0120326_0120954 LIKE IF YOU'RE DOING IT ON ON THE WORD BASIS HERE WITH THOSE WORDS THAT IN THE END YOU THEN TIE IT BACK IN INTO THE RIGHT SEGMENT HERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0120954_0120985 I MEAN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0121083_0121220 YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO DO A BIT OF
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0122094_0122139 HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0123100_0123356 YOU'RE DOING IT TIME BASED AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0123356_0123848 SO THIS ISN'T DIRECTLY HAVING TIME REFERENCES BUT YOU CAN GET THE OH IT IS ACTUALLY HERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0124076_0124168 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0124168_0124867 SO IF YOU SLICE IT UP BY TIME YOU'D PROBABLY BE ABLE TO JUST LIKE ATTACH LIKE JUST SOME ATTRIBUTE OF
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0125104_0125494 INFO VAL JUST F TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0126783_0126822 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0128127_0128227 'KAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0128227_0128671 UM I DON'T UNDERSTAND ENOUGH OF WHAT THEIR DATA STRUCTURE IS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0128671_0129163 THIS PROBABLY WOULD BE A LOT EASIER WOULD I REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE HANDLING THE DATA INTERNALLY 'CAUSE THEN WE C THEN I COULD SAY OH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0129163_0129544 IT'S EASY TO JUST TIE IT IN IF YOU JUST HAVE IT TIME STAMPED THAT JUST REFERENCE BY WORDS AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0129657_0129846 BUT T AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0130779_0131033 SO YOU WOULD YOU'RE DOING I YOU'RE DOING A WORD BY WORD BASE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0131500_0131535 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0132107_0132145 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0132485_0133131 BUT EVERY WORD DOES DOES THE WORD PICKING LIKE DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION VALUE IN YOUR THING I DOES IT DEPEND ON ITS POSITION LIKE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0133258_0133443 IT BE D DEPENDS ON THE POSITION
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0133680_0133772 HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0134008_0134398 AND YOU'RE DOING THIS VIA SOME SOFTWARE THAT'S LIKE EXTERNAL SOFTWARE SO YOU CAN'T
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0134762_0135235 SO WHAT IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU GET THE RESULTS FROM THAT SOFTWARE AND YOU GO BACK OVER IT THEN WITH THAT FILE SORT OF
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0135235_0135749 YOU WRITE AN ALGORITHM WHICH WHICH THEN GOES BACK BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT ORDER STILL AND STUFF RIGHT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0135749_0135945 SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0135945_0136255 OH BUT THIS IS BY SPEAKER HERE WHICH MAKES IT SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0136689_0137107 THE PROBLEM IS THAT ACTUALLY NITE X. M. L. PROBABLY PROVIDES A LOT OF THE TOOLS THAT WE'D NEED TO DO THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0138050_0138193 IN IN A TEMPORAL SEQUENCE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0142073_0142496 BUT BUT WOULD THE INFORMATION DENSITY ALGORITHM STILL MAKE ANY SENSE IF YOU SPLIT THEM UP
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0142496_0143608 BECAUSE I MEAN THE WHOLE I THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY OF A WORD IN THAT SPECIFIC HOW OFTEN A WORD INC OCCURS IN A CERTAIN TOPIC VERSUS HOW OFTEN IT OCCURS OVER THE WHOLE CORPUS AND THAT FROM THAT IT CALCULATES
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0144542_0144581 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0146693_0146927 YEAH I HAVE A GUT FEELING IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SPLIT IT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0147032_0147115 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0147115_0147263 NO BUT I MEAN IT CAN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0147263_0147835 IF YOU IF YOU ALREADY HAVE YOU HAVE IN THE RIGHT ORDER ALL THE WORDS WITH A WITH A SCORE TO THEM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0147835_0148215 AND YOU HAVE A FILE WHICH HAS EACH WORD AND A TIME STAMP
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0148215_0148518 SO THOSE TWO TIED TOGETHER HAVE EACH WORD AND ITS TIME AND
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0148710_0149014 AND AND AND ITS PROBA AND ITS VALUE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0149014_0149041 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0150795_0151008 SO THEY'RE THEY'RE AT THE MOMENT SO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0152443_0152729 IT APPEARS TO ME THAT RAINBOW WAS MADE FOR SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0152866_0152927 HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0153503_0154317 I ACTUALLY LIKE UM UM I ARE YOU ACTUALLY SURE THAT RAINBOW IS DOING A MEASURE LIKE IS RETURNING A MEASURE OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO MEASURE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0154317_0154859 'CAUSE IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S JUST IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT IN IN D MANY ASPECTS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0155323_0155364 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0155989_0156015 AND W
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0156704_0156743 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0157519_0157555 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0158828_0159093 BUT WHERE DO YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL CATEGORY INFORMATION FROM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0159932_0159964 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0160630_0160662 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0161023_0161314 SO WHERE DO YOU WHERE DO YOU HAVE THEM FROM AT THE MOMENT THE SPLIT UP
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0161629_0162338 IN I IN THE T IN THE TOPICS IN THE IN THE HUMAN TOPIC S UM SO YOU'VE SPLIT THEM UP BY TOPIC AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0163777_0163825 YEAH BUT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0164698_0164897 OKAY OKAY OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0164897_0165335 'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL BUT YEAH IF YOU IF THAT'S JUST WHILE YOU'RE WAITING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0165335_0165510 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0165510_0166288 HAVE YOU EVER LIKE LOOKED INTO DIFFERENT WAYS OF CALCULATING 'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING LIKE I MEAN THE FOR EXAMPLE THE THE INFOR UM WHAT'S IT CALLED
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0166288_0167050 THE ENTROPY CALCULATION IS THAT SHE BOXED IT UNDER THE SIMPLE CALCULATION THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY WRITE THE SCRIPT IN NO TIME AT ALL AND
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0168167_0168901 YEAH BUT I'M ALSO JUST LIKE I THINK THAT PROBABLY THE ENTROPY VALUE AT THE MOMENT FOR A WORD IS CLOSER TO WHAT WE'RE AT THE MOMENT LOOKING FOR
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0168901_0170355 I CAN JUST LIKE K K I CAN SIT TOGETHER WITH YOU FOR TWENTY MINUTES AND JUST SHOW YOU THE ENTROPY CODE THAT I WROTE FOR MY OTHER PROJECT AND IT PROBABLY AND WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S WE USED T WE HAVE TO WE'D USE THE SAME MATRIX AS I'M USING IN MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0170355_0170596 YOU'D USE TO CALCULATE ENTROPY SCORES
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0170596_0171352 AND THEN WE'D HAVE UM A SCORE WHICH ACTUALLY WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME FOR THE WORD IN EACH POSITION
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0171352_0171554 SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S DOING SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0171554_0172347 AND LIKE W BASICALLY THE SCORE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A CONDITIONAL ENTROPY SCORE WHICH JUST CHECKS HOW MUCH INFORMATION
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0172347_0172706 THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONE WORD TELLS YOU ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT WORD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0172706_0173003 BUT THAT'S A RELATIVELY GOOD MEASURE OF WHETHER THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC WORD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0173003_0173494 IN WHICH CASE THEY ARE USUALLY WORDS WHICH TELL YOU QUITE A LOT OR A VERY GENERAL WORD WHICH USUALLY DOESN'T TELL YOU QUITE A LOT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0173732_0174122 UM IT IT'S BASICALLY THE IT'S THE STANDARD ENTROPY FORMULA
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0174122_0174226 AND YOU SORT OF YOU YOU
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0174786_0174896 YES YES IT HAS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0174896_0174924 I MEAN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0174924_0175922 I THINK THE OFFICIAL LE SORT OF THE OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT TELLS YOU IS UM HOW MUCH THAT LIKE THE FACT THAT A GIVEN WORD OCCURS TELLS YOU ABOUT WHAT'S THE NEXT WORD'S GONNA BE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0175922_0176035 WHICH DOESN'T SOUND TOO EXCITING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0176035_0176846 BUT IT IT JUST WORKS OUT IN THE WAY THAT WORDS WHICH ARE PROMISCUOUS AND WHICH OCCUR WITH EVERYTHING ALL OVER THE PLACE HAVE VERY LOW A SCORES ON THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0176846_0177129 AND ALSO USUALLY END UP BEING THE WORDS WHICH ARE P
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0177252_0177579 LEAST LIKE EXPRESSIVE AND L CONTAIN LESS INFORMATION
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0177792_0178075 YEAH FUNCTION WORDS OR JUST VERY GENERAL NOUNS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0178075_0178402 PR PROBABLY LIKE WHAT WHATEV FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD COMPUTER IN THAT CONTEXT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0178402_0178689 YOU COULD IMAGINE IT TO F LIKE BE IN ALL IN ALL THE CONTEXTS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0180625_0181031 YEAH SO WE WOULD WE W WOULDN'T DO IT BY WORD WE WOULD SORRY OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0181031_0181568 UM I WAS I WAS GETTING THAT W ACTUALLY SORRY I WAS GETTING THAT WRONG I WAS GETTING IT FROM WHAT I DID MY PROJECT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0181568_0182029 NOW IN THIS CASE WE WOULD DO IT BY PER MEE WORDS PER MEETING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0182194_0182273 SO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0183122_0183149 HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0183770_0184088 YES IT IT'S PROBABLY DOING IT'S PROBABLY DOING QUITE THE SAME THING IN THE END
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0184088_0184854 BUT I'M JUST SAYING LIKE WITH THAT THING YOU WOULD EASILY HAVE AN ALGORITHM WHICH AT THE MOMENT PROVIDES YOU FOR EACH WORD WITH A SCORE WHICH WE CAN USE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0185057_0185389 UM NO UM I WAS I WAS I WAS DESCRIBING THE WRONG THING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0185389_0185619 IN THIS CASE WE WOULDN'T BE DOING HOW MUCH IT TELLS YOU ABOUT ANOTHER WORD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0185619_0186275 IN THIS CASE WE WOULD BE DOING GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW A WORD HOW GOOD IS IT AT PREDICTING FROM WHICH UM SPECIFIC TOPIC THAT WAS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0186474_0186723 SO THAT WOULD YEAH IN THAT SENSE IT'S THE SAME THING HERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0187493_0187712 YEAH YEAH FOR A SPECIFIC
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0188127_0188161 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0188434_0189062 THE SAME WORD THE WORD YESTERDAY WOULD BE WOULD HAVE THE SAME SCORE ALL OVER THE PLACE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0189860_0189918 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0190423_0190436 I C
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0191426_0192178 BUT BUT YOUR CATEGORY THING DEPENDS ON THAT WE NOT JUST HAVE TOPIC SEGMENTS BUT ALSO THAT THESE TOPIC SEGMENTS WE HAVE THEM IN CATEGORIES
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0192348_0192729 YOU YOU DO WOULDN'T YOU NEED SEVERAL DOCUMENTS FOR EACH CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0192729_0192904 OR SEVERAL SEGMENTS FOR EACH CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0193242_0193492 DO BUT WILL IT WORD WITHOUT THAT AT ALL
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0193627_0193665 'CAUSE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0194502_0194765 YEAH I MEAN S SO IN OUR CASE BASICALLY EVERY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0194900_0195117 EVERY S TOPIC WOULD BE ITS OWN CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0195250_0195732 AND THE QUESTION IS DOES THE ALGORITHM STILL MAKE ANY SENSE IN THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ALGORITHM ENOUGH FOR THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0195732_0196885 BUT WHAT I'M REALLY LIKE BECAUSE THE ENTROPICAL UM CALCULATION IS SO SIMPLE MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK INTO MAKING THAT SCORE JUST AS A PRELIMINARY SCORE THAT WE HAVE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0196885_0197129 LIKE IT IT'S A VERY IT GIVES YOU LIKE I'VE LOOKED AT THE RESULT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0197129_0197639 IT GIVES YOU BASICALLY SOMETHING IN THE END WHICH VAGUELY TELLS YOU JUST WHETHER A WORD IS A VERY SPECIFIC WORD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0197746_0197875 OR A VERY GENERAL WORD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0197997_0198044 AND
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0198167_0198661 I LIKE THERE IS SOME HOPE THAT PROBABLY HAVING JUST SENTENCES WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF VERY SPECIFIC WORDS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0198661_0199216 IF YOU MARK THEM AS BEING MORE INTERESTING THAN THE WORDS WHICH ARE ONLY VERY GENERAL WORDS THAT THEY WOULD GET US SOMEWHERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0200176_0200442 PROBABLY ONE POINT ZERO IS VERY HIGH INFORMATION VALUE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0201124_0201276 YEAH 'CAUSE THIS WOULD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0201445_0201972 YEAH IN IN A SENSE I MEAN THIS IS A BIT LIKE THE WHAT LIKE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY OVER TOTAL FREQUENCY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0202079_0202257 MEASURE IT SORT OF JUST GOING BY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0203930_0204101 WHAT DO YOU MEAN EVERY SEQUENCE OF THE SAME
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0204709_0204736 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0205236_0205556 WITHIN TH WITHIN THE TOPIC SO LIKE TOPIC WE HAD TO WHEN YOU SAY TOPIC
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0205556_0206116 YOU MEAN LIKE JUST LIKE FROM FROM A BEGINNING TO END POINT LIKE WITHIN ONE MEETING THERE ARE SEVERAL TOPICS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0206848_0207069 BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION ANYWHERE DO WE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0208500_0208675 BUT BUT YOU YOU ARE SEGMENTING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0208937_0209211 WELL I'M I'M DOING ONE ON SEGMENT SIMILARITY IN THE END YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0209211_0209762 I'M DOING LIKE FINDING SIMILAR SEGMENTS BASIC LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0209762_0209855 BUT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0210013_0210606 BUT LIKE F FOR NOW LIKE YOUR SEGMENTATION IS JUST SPLITTING A MEETING UP INTO DIFFERENT BLOCKS VER
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0211013_0211352 NOT NOT FROM WHAT COLIN IS DOING FROM WHAT I NO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0211352_0212158 IT'S ONLY LIKE I'M WRITING AN ALGORITHM THAT WHICH THEN TRIES TO ALSO AGAIN BASED ON WORD P OCCURRENCE PATTERNS TRY TO LINK TOGETHER MAYBE DIFFERENT ONES OF THOSE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0212657_0212731 SO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0214979_0215166 SO THAT YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0217121_0217502 YEAH I'M ALSO A BIT B LIKE I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE ABOUT RAINBOW BEING THE RIGHT THING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0217502_0218277 'CAUSE IT SEEMS THAT RAINBOW DOES IN ITS STRUCTURE QUITE RELY ON HAVING DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF THE SAME CATEGORY SORT OF IN IN A WAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0220019_0220050 'KAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0222202_0223289 YOU KNOW WHAT AS A BYPRODUCT OF MY L. S. A. I'LL PROVIDE UM A VOCABULARY LIKE SORT OF A DICTIONARY WHICH FOR EACH WORD GIVES AN ENTROPY SCORE ENTROPY SCORE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0223289_0224033 WHICH JUST TELLS YOU OF HOW MUCH INFORMATION THE PRESENCE OF A WORD TELLS YOU ABOUT WHICH TOPIC IT IS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0224033_0224514 NOT WHICH CATEGORY LIKE I'M NOT I'M NOT LUMPING TOGETHER SEPARATE TOPIC SEGMENTS INTO CATEGORIES
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0224514_0225382 BUT JUST LIKE HOW MUCH THIS WORD TELLS YOU ABOUT WH HOW LIKELY THAT W THE OCCURRENCE OF THAT WORD MAKES IT THAT IT'S A SPECIFIC SEGMENT TOPIC SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0225382_0226164 WHICH IS SOME MEASURE ALREADY OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS WORD IS VERSUS HOW SPECIFIC F TO A CERTAIN SEGMENT THAT IS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0226164_0226646 AND I'LL JUST PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT MUCH MORE WORK THAN JUST THE USUAL THING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0226646_0226880 AND THEN WE CAN SEE HOW WE CAN TIE THAT IN WITH THE OTHER STUFF
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0227003_0227644 SO IF YOU UM KEEP ON WORKING ON RAINBOW MEANWHILE AND TRY TO FIND A WAY HOW TO TIE YOUR RAINBOW STUFF INTO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0227880_0228280 SOME WAY THAT WE CAN ATTACH IT TO A CERTAIN TIME SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0229146_0229358 I'M JUST THINKING WH IF
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0229464_0230239 IT IT USED IS EACH WORD COMPLETELY UNIQUE LIKE SORT OF DOES IT TREAT EACH WORD EACH OCCURRENCE OF WORD AS A COMPLETELY UNIQUE EVENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0230239_0230763 OR DOES IT I MEAN NO IT IT HAS TO I MEAN BASICALLY THE THE FORM OF THE WORD IS IMPORTANT RIGHT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0230763_0230982 WE CAN'T JUST REPLACE THE WORD BY AN ARBITRARY STRING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0231133_0231353 BECAUSE IT LOOKS IF THE SAME WORD OCCURS AGAIN AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0231487_0231819 YEAH IT IT HAS TO WORK WITH A M YEAH WELL I THINK IT'S A STUPID QUESTION
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0231819_0232393 LIKE IT IT IT HAS TO WORK ON ON ON THE WORD LIKE ON
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0232542_0233101 WHAT I WAS THINKING IS WHETHER IF WE REPLACE THE WORD BY SOMETHING UNIQUELY ID IDENTIFIABLE THEN IT WOULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENT WHICH ORDER IT IS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0233101_0233421 BUT THAT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT NEEDS THE WORD BECAUSE THAT'S ALL IT'S WORKING ON
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0233421_0233953 IT'S THE WORD AND THAT LOOKS IF THAT WORD OCCURS AGAIN AND VERSUS HOW OFTEN THAT WORD OCCURS IN OTHER CONTEXT RIGHT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0233953_0234331 SO WE CAN'T ATTACH SOME TYPE OF INFORMATION TO THE WORD JUST TO THE WORD STRING ITSELF
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0234331_0234629 LIKE MAKING AN UNDERSCORE MAKING THE TIME OR SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T WORK
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0235948_0236451 BUT WOULD IT HAVE THAT IN THE UNTRUNCATED VERSION THEN LIKE WOULD IT S WOULD THE OUTPUT BE THE UNTRUNCATED VERSION
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0236451_0236705 IT WILL PROBABLY UM NO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0238682_0238859 YEAH FOR NOW I MEAN REALLY JUST LIKE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0239103_0239492 YEAH I THINK IF WE WORK TOGETHER ON AN ON AN ENTROPY BASED SCORE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0239492_0239766 IT'S LET ME SEE IF I CAN DEMONSTRATE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0239884_0240202 T I MEAN LET'S JUST KEEP ON TALKING MEANWHILE AND I'LL TRY TO START THAT UP
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0240429_0240771 IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY D IT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING BUT IT IT BASICALLY JUST
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0240894_0241234 DOES SOMETHING WHICH TELLS YOU HOW SPECIFIC A WORD IS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0241234_0242144 IN A SENSE IT'S IN A IT'S IT'S BASICALLY JUST TO TO A HIGH DEGREE REALLY TELLING YOU HOW R HOW RARE A WORD IS OR HOW COMMON A WORD IS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0242144_0242760 BUT UH AS AS THE FIRST STEP THAT'S PROBABLY FOR FOR A PROTOTYPE FOR NEXT WEEK THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A BAD THING I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S JUST THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0242760_0243560 EVEN IF YOU JUST LIKE IF YOU HAVE SEGMENTS WHERE WHERE LOTS OF RARE WORDS OCCUR HIGHLIGHTED IN DARKER RED THAN SEGMENTS WHERE ALL THE VERY COMMON WORDS OCCUR
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0243560_0243739 THAT'S JUST THAT'S SOMEWHERE TO START FROM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0243944_0244584 AND IT'S IT'S A BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT BUT THEN DE FACTO IT JUST ENDS UP DOING THAT MOSTLY FROM WHAT I FIGURED OUT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0244976_0245053 UM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0245658_0246094 ACTUALLY I THINK I'M NOT GONNA NOT GONNA START THAT NOW BECAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE TOO LONG
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0246304_0246357 SO
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0246559_0247041 IF WE GET IT ON A WORD BY WORD BASIS WHATEVER YOU DO IT'LL PROBABLY APPEAR IN A WORD BY WORD BASIS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0247041_0247459 AND WHAT YOU HAVE ON A SORT OF SEGMENT BUT NOT QUITE SEGMENT BASE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0250254_0250409 'KAY WHAT ABOUT THE FOLLOWING MODEL
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0250409_0250652 I MEAN THIS IS A VERY UNSCIENTIFIC WAY OF DOING IT IN SOME SENSE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0250652_0251521 BUT WHAT IF WE IF WE TAKE TIME AS THE STANDARD UNIT FOR NOW AND SORT OF LIKE MAKE A MASSIVE ONE SEGMENT SPLIT SUPER ARRAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0251521_0252058 BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING CAN IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BE TI TIED DOWN TO ACTUAL TIME
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0252058_0252478 SO IF WE IF WE IF FOR IF FOR EACH ONE SEGMENT TIME SLOT WE COULD ATTACH A VALUE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0252478_0252839 AND THEN IT WOULD BE EASY TO THEN GO BACK WHEN IF WE HAVE THE TIME MARKS HERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0252839_0253234 AND RE MAP THAT ONTO ONTO THE LENGTH OF A SEGMENT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0253234_0253840 SO IF YOU HAVE FOR EACH WORD SAY AND WE KNOW THAT WORD STARTS AT THIS SEGMENT AND ENDS AT THAT SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0253840_0254523 AND YOU HAVE FOR LIKE FOR SOME TIME PERIOD W THE OVERLAP AND THAT PERIOD ON THE F. ONES AND THAT PERIOD OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0254523_0254880 SO YOU ALSO HAVE A VALUE WHICH CAN BE TIED DOWN TO A TIME
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0254880_0255442 AND THEN WE COULD JUST IN M IN MATLAB OR IN SOMETHING JUST CREATE SOME MASSIVE SUPER ARRAY OF
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0255664_0256392 OF THINGS FOR EACH FOR EACH LIKE SORT OF TIME SAMPLING SLOT AND AND CALCULATE A VALUE FOR THIS AND ONCE WE HAVE THIS ARRAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0256521_0256952 WE CAN GO WITH THE SCRIPT AND SORT OF GO FOR EACH SEGMENT TO THE STARTING AND END TIMES AND SAY OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0256952_0257390 THIS IS FROM OUR TIME SEGMENT F HERE TO THIS TIME SEGMENT THERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0257390_0257966 SO WE TAKE THE SOME OF THOSE AND DIVIDE THEM BY BY THE NUMBER OR SOMETHING CREATE THE AVERAGE AND PUT IT IN AS THE VALUE FOR THE SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0257966_0258040 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0258957_0258981 OH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0259127_0259501 THA THAT'S THAT'S A FIDDLING PLAY IN THE END BUT THAT PROBLEM WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0259501_0260060 BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A USEFUL WAY OF AUTOMATICALLY EVALUATING UM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0260244_0260694 WE DON'T HAVE A WAY OF USEFULLY EVALUATING AUTOMATICALLY WHAT'S GOOD AND WHAT'S BAD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0260694_0261198 SO IT'S IT'S PROBABLY ALWAYS GONNA BE A QUESTION OF LOOKING AT IT AND SAYING OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0261198_0261933 LIKE RUNNING IT WITH DIFFERENT DIFFERENT FACTOR LOADINGS AND SEEING OKAY THIS WAY IT WORKS THIS WELL AND THIS WAY IT WORKS THAT WELL
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0264038_0264630 BUT IT PROBABLY BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR MAPPED T TO MAP FOR YOU TO MAP IT ON SO FOR YOU SORT OF I
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0266356_0267318 YEAH BUT SO YOU SAY THAT INST LIKE YOU BASICALLY SAY W HAVING AN ARRAY WHERE EACH EACH CELL IS IS ONE LIKE IS O IS ONE WORD
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0267318_0267645 AND THEN YOU WOULD MAP YOUR INFORMATION ONTO INDIVIDUAL WORDS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0268095_0268117 HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0268574_0268880 WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHICH WORD THAT IS AND
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0269404_0269430 'KAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0269430_0270505 AND AND THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE SOME TYPE OF JUST POINT IN THE END WHERE THE ONE SCORES FROM THE ALL THE INDIVIDUAL WORD CELLS GET MULTIPLIED ALL WITH LIKE FOR EACH UTTERANCE OR WHATEVER
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0270505_0270899 YOU HAVE GET ALL MULTIPLIED WITH THE SAME VALUE ALL THE ONES THAT ARE WITHIN THAT UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0270899_0271143 THAT'S SORT OF THE COMBINATION OF OF THE TWO SCORES
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0271495_0271897 AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK AGAIN AND THEN PUT THAT BACK INTO THAT SEGMENT MODE HERE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0272024_0272417 SO THAT WE BECAUSE IN THE END WE DON'T WANT IT ON A PER WORD BASIS BUT PROBABLY ON A PER SEGMENT BASE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0273593_0273894 OH YEAH YEAH ACTUALLY THAT YEAH THAT'S TRUE SO THAT IT'S EASIER IF YOU
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0274058_0274400 ARE ABLE TO YEAH WELL I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BACK WHERE WE STARTED AT THIS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0274400_0274834 BUT YOU SAID IT WI BUT YOU SAID IT'S MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOUR SEGMENTS AREN'T THOSE SEGMENTS EXACTLY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0276192_0276347 HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0276347_0276484 AND THEIR SEGMENTS DO OVERLAP
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0276660_0276861 UH THE THO THOSE DO OR THOSE DON'T
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0277591_0277638 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0278345_0278414 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0278414_0279339 SO YOU COULD ON THEIR GRANULARITY YOU COULD ON THEIR GRANULARITY CREATE A SCORE LIKE FOR EACH FOR EACH OF THEIR SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0279646_0280126 WELL I GUESS I MEAN FOR YOU IF YOU KNOW FOR EACH WORD IF YOU FIND THAT OUT THEN IT HAS TO BE POSSIBLE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0280126_0280841 BECAUSE IF WE KNOW SORT OF THIS IS GOING FROM WORD TO WORD OR IT THIS IS GOING FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEN THERE HAS TO BE A WAY THEN FOR YOU SAY OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0280841_0281411 THIS CONCERNS THESE FOLLOWING WORDS AND THEN JUST MAKE MAKE A SIMPLE MEAN OVER THEM
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0281603_0282071 I THINK AN INTERESTING THING IS IF WE DON'T COMBINE YOUR TWO SCORES IN THE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0282221_0282468 IN THE X. M. L. FILE YOU HAD BUT IF WE DO THAT IN THE SOFTWARE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0282468_0283189 THEN WE CAN PROBABLY MAKE WAYS OF PLAYING WITH IT IN THE SOFTWARE AND SORT OF L YOU KNOW LIKE ADAPTING SOME SORT OF CONTROL
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0283189_0284153 LIKE PLAYING AROUND WITH LOOK LIKE IT'S PLAYING WITH DIFFERENT WEIGHTINGS FOR THAT THE UTTERANCE BASED ONE VERSUS THE WORD BASED ONE AND SORT OF LOOK AT IT DYNAMICALLY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0284153_0284211 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0284361_0284865 LIKE PLAYING AROUND SORT OF FIGURING OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY OF COMBINING THEM BY PLAYING AROUND AND LOOKING AT THE RESULTS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0285769_0285816 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0286062_0286563 YEAH WE COULD PROBABLY LIKE MAKE A UH UM GRAPHIC DISPLAY INITIALLY AT LEAST FOR OUR EXPERIMENTING
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0286563_0287091 WE'D JUST PLACE THEM IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEN SEE HOW THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0287372_0287431 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0287431_0287535 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0287535_0288464 SO DO YOU THINK Y LIKE BOTH OF YOU THEN CAN MAP SOMETHING ONTO THEIR SEGMENTS LIKE JUST EACH OF YOU PROVIDE ONE VALUE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0288464_0289136 LIKE DOUBLE VALUE OR WHATEVER LIKE ONE DECIMAL VALUE OR WHATEVER ONTO ONTO EXACTLY THEIR SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0290128_0290258 IT'S STATED BOTH IN
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0290417_0290716 IT'S DONE BOTH IN TERMS OF WORDS AND IN TERMS OF SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0290716_0291134 IT'S A BIT SAD SORT OF THAT WE DO THIS BEFORE WE'VE TRULY FIGURED OUT HOW THE NITE X. M. L. THING WORKS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0291134_0291981 BECAUSE NOW WE'RE DOING IT ALL BY HAND AND LIKE PARSING AND UN PARSING THAT THING AND IT'S IT'S ALL PART OF THE FRAMEWORK
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0291981_0292091 UH
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0292221_0292484 HOW MUCH EASIER WOULD IT BE IF WE TRULY UNDERSTOOD THIS

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0293456_0294238 I MIGHT JUST CHANGE MY ORDER OF IN WHICH I DO THINGS AND LIKE FORGET MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS STUFF UNTIL THE WEEKEND AND TRY TO REALLY MAKE SENSE OF THE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0294436_0295272 OF THE NITE DATA SYSTEM NOW SO THAT MAYBE AS SOON AS I'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE FIND WAYS OF DOING THAT IN WITHIN THE NITE FRAMEWORK ALREADY
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0295272_0295773 SO THAT WE DON'T MANUALLY HAVE TO PARSE TIMES AND ENTIRE THINGS TOGETHER

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0300341_0300955 AND IF YOU'RE BOTH ABLE TO MAP INTO THOSE SEGMENTS THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ONE FILE WHERE WE HAVE LIKE WHATEVER TWO VALUES
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0300955_0301195 VALUE A. AND VALUE B. BOTH AS ATTRIBUTES FOR
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0301443_0301481 FOR THIS
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0301784_0302427 AND THAT WE COULD LOAD INTO A PROTOTYPE AND SEE WHAT TYPES OF DISP WHAT WAYS OF DISPLAYING THIS INFORMATION ARE THERE

AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0338167_0338733 THAT PROBABLY MAKES IT A LOT EASIER THEN BUT IT'S SORT OF IT'S A BOOT STRAPPING PROBLEM LIKE FOR THE PROTOTYPE WE NEED SOME TYPE OF DATA
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0338733_0339057 BUT TO DEVELOP THE DATA IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO TO HAVE THE PROTOTYPE
AMI_EN2001b_H01_MEO069_0339236_0339340 ANYWAY I GOTTA GO

AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0141098_0141687 IT'S IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT INPUT I GIVE TO UM TO RAINBOW
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0141687_0142033 SO I JUST COULD G USE THE FILES AS THEY ARE
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0142033_0142291 I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THAT WOULD GIVE AN OUTPUT
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0142430_0142520 I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0143621_0144025 NO IT UM I THINK IT'S NOT UH VERSUS THE WHOLE CORPUS
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0144025_0145384 IT'S UM YOU HAVE CERTAIN CATEGORIES AND YOU MEASURE WHICH WORDS UM HAVE THE HIGHEST INFORMATION FOR ONE CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0145384_0145733 SO IT'S THE CATEGORIES ACROSS EACH OTHER I THINK
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0146265_0146680 UM PROBABLY YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0146680_0146955 BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S S STRANGE
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0147703_0147728 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0149113_0149447 YEAH BUT WHAT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0149447_0150104 I THINK THE INFORMATION GAIN IN RAINBOW IS ORDERED BY THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION GAIN
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0150104_0150598 NOT I AM NOT SURE IF I CAN GET THE RIGHT ORDER AND THE VALUES
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0150756_0150846 THAT'S THE PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0150963_0151508 BUT I UM IF THE ORDER STAYS THE SAME IT'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL TO I JUST WRITE BACK AGAIN
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0151508_0152367 BUT IF UH IT'S ORDERED BY INFORMATION GAIN I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WORDS COME FROM BECAUSE IT'S IT HAS A BAG OF WORDS REPRESENTATION
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0152610_0152708 UH YES
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0152708_0152811 IS IT IS
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0152811_0153011 IT WAS MADE FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0153428_0153542 YEAH THAT'S THE PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0154755_0155666 YEAH UM WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IS THAT YOU YOU PUT IN SOME DOCUMENTS AND YOU HAVE SEVERAL DOCUMENTS PER CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0155784_0156007 UM AND YOU HAVE SEVERAL CATEGORIES
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0156007_0156731 AND THEN IT MEASURES UM WHICH WORDS ARE TYPICAL FOR A CERTAIN T CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0156731_0157603 AND IF YOU GET A NEW DOCUMENT IT WILL UM COMPARE WHICH WORDS ARE IN THAT NEW DOCUMENT
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0157603_0158082 AND IF THERE ARE A LOT OF WORDS THAT UM ARE TYPICAL FOR ONE CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0158082_0158710 IT WILL ASSIGN IT TO THAT CATEGORY AND IF IT'S TYPICAL FOR ANOTHER ONE IT WILL ASSIGN IT TO THAT ONE
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0159135_0159744 YEAH IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE UM Y UM YOU HAVE UM OTH DIFFERENT FILES
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0159744_0160633 IF IF THIS IS YOUR DIRECTORY YOU HAVE UM UM A DIAGRA UM A DIRECTORY ONE TWO AND THREE
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0160633_0160879 AND THIS REPRESENTS THE CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0160879_0161127 EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THERE IS IN CATEGORY ONE
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0161376_0161616 YEAH JUST SPLIT IT UP SOMEHOW YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0161766_0161797 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0162336_0163267 NO I'VE JUST UM SPLIT THEM UP UH SOMEHOW UM BY UM THERE ARE SEVERAL DOCUMENTS FOR
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0163479_0164132 UM EACH MEETING AND I JUST PUT ONE IN EACH CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0164132_0164773 SO UH IT'S IT'S NOT VERY SENSIBLE AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE I'M WAITING FOR THE UM TOPIC SEGMENTS OR I'M JUST YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0166781_0166958 YEAH YEAH PROBABLY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0166958_0167731 YEAH MAYBE IT'S IT'S BETTER IF I WRITE IT MYSELF BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S TOO EASY TO JUST SPLIT THINGS UP INTO BINS
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0167731_0168170 AND IT IT WOULDN'T BE ANY WORK AT ALL IN TERMS OF PROGRAMMING OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0169597_0169630 ALRIGHT

AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0173506_0173672 HOW DOES IT CALCULATE THAT ACTUALLY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0174099_0174142 OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0182336_0183046 YEAH BUT THAT'S THE SA UH ALMOST I THINK SIMILAR TO WHAT I'M DOING BECAUSE WORDS THAT ARE IN EVERY CLASS
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0183046_0183709 THAT ARE NOT VERY INFORMATIVE BUT WORDS THAT ARE ONLY IN ONE CLASS ARE ARE VERY INFORMATIVE FOR THAT CLASS
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0184626_0184678 OH OKAY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0184876_0184910 ALRIGHT

AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0189033_0189106 ALL OVER THE PLACE
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0189106_0189862 AND IN MY CASE IT WOULD HAVE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT UH VALUES FOR EACH CATEGORY
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0189862_0190248 BUT IN THAT CATEGORY IT WOULD HAVE THE SAME VALUE AT EACH PLACE
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0190416_0190583 DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0191486_0191519 YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0192772_0193357 UM THAT WOULD BE BEST BUT I I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK IF THAT
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0193521_0194586 UM AT LEAST IT WORKS IF THERE ARE SEVERAL CATEGORIES WITH EACH WITH ONE DOCUMENT EACH BUT IT UM YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0195295_0195601 YEAH THAT'S THE QUESTIO YEAH I DON'T KNOW

AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0215711_0216731 AND THAT UM SPLITTING AT CATEGORY BOUNDARIES UM SPLITTING AT TOPIC BOUNDARIES WOULD A NICE THING TO DO RATHER THAN JUST SPLITTING SOMEWHERE
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0216731_0216967 SO YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0218267_0218938 YEAH BUT IT I THINK IT SHOULD WORK FOR JUST ONE DOCUMENT BECAUSE IT IT COMPARES BETWEEN THE CATEGORIES
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0218938_0219971 AND IF YOU JUST HAVE ONE DOCUMENT UM IT STILL CAN FIND OUT WHICH WORDS ARE INFORMATIVE FOR THAT CATEGORY AND WHICH ARE NOT
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0219971_0220844 SO IF YOU HAVE JUST ONE DOCUMENT IN EACH CATEGORY AND THERE ARE A LOT OF UM OCCURRENCES OF THE WORD THE IN EACH ONE
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0220844_0221298 SO THIS WORD WILL BE NOT VERY INFORMATIVE ACROSS THE CATEGORIES
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0221298_0221913 SO IT SHOULD WORK FOR ONE BUT I'M NOT SURE IF HOW EXACTLY IT IT UM CALCULATES EVERYTHING
AMI_EN2001b_H02_FEO065_0221913_0222144 UH I THINK IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO LOOK THAT UP

AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0041977_0043225 I THINK THOSE S. S AND E. S AND SO ON THE SINGLE LETTERS ARE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WITH MY UM FIRST VERSION OF THE TEXT THING
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0043225_0043337 'CAUSE I THINK THE
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0047796_0047819 HMM

AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0082099_0082267 I UH THINK IT MIGHT
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0082267_0083394 WHY BECAUSE UM I UM STEVE LAY QUITE A LOT OF UM WEIGHT ON UM YOU KNOW UH SURFING THROUGH MEETINGS
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0083577_0084035 SO WE SHOULD AT LEAST PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF DIFFERENT MEETINGS OF ONE GROUP
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0084035_0084424 AT THE BEGINNING HE UM TALKED QUITE A LOT ABOUT THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0089792_0090193 UM AND WHAT ABOUT THE SIMILARITY MEASURE FOR SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0090193_0091006 DO WE UM ALSO PRESENT THAT IN THIS WINDOW AND DO WE DO IT ACROSS MEETINGS
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0091006_0091320 UH I THINK THAT WAS PLANNED AT THE BEGINNING WASN'T IT
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0092248_0092280 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0092796_0092890 UH OKAY

AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0094245_0094711 I I'M JUST COMING BACK TO OUR INITIAL IDEA OF PRESENTING SOME YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0094711_0095329 ALL THE SIMILAR SEGMENTS IN UH ACROSS MEETINGS AND SEPARATING BY UH SOME THINGS LIKE
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0097480_0097508 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0112945_0113156 OH I I HAVE THAT FILE

AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0130408_0130690 YEAH BUT ALSO SPEEDING UP THE AUDIOS AND S
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0152936_0153492 UM WHERE WE HAVE A MOVING BAND THE GRAPHICAL DISPLAY THAT ALSO MOVES ACCORDING TO THE
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0153614_0153641 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0165228_0165683 UH F I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I CAN UH ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO IMPROVE THERE

AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0178106_0178200 YEAH TEN PERCENT
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0207967_0209027 SO SO YOU WANT UM THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBERS TO BE UM CONTINUOUS THROUGHOUT THE CORPUS SO THAT SECOND MEETINGS BEGINS WITH THREE HUNDRED UM SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0214394_0215769 COULDN'T WE COULDN'T WE JUST UM TAKE THE UM A NAME EACH UM EACH DIALOGUE ACT UM MEETING DOT UM DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0215769_0215946 IT WOULD BE A LA LONGER NAME BUT
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0231748_0231959 A PROBLEM UM YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0232140_0233346 FOR EXAMPLE AS THERE ARE NOT UM F. ZERO VALUES FOR EVERY SPEAKER OR ON SOMETIMES NOT FOR EVERY MEETING UM HOW WILL I COUNT THAT UP
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0233346_0233398 I MEAN

AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0234573_0234984 BUT BECAUSE I MEAN IT'S NOT ZERO IT'S JUST A NOUN
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0235904_0236523 BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE IF THAT JUST WOULDN'T BE PART OF IT THEN
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0236523_0236567 THE
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0237177_0237194 HMM

AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0243348_0244101 YEAH BUT DO WE REALLY WANT DO DISPLAY THEM SEPARATELY BECAUSE THE USER WON'T OKAY FOR NOW FOR OUR S OKAY
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0244814_0245873 YEAH BUT THEN THE USER WOULD HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT S W WAS WHAT AND WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE BLUE STRIPES AND WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE RED ONES
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0245873_0246038 UH I THINK THAT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD IDEA
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0246519_0246546 MM-HMM

AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0258183_0259894 COULDN'T WE COULDN'T WE WRITE ONE PROGRAMME THAT CALCULATES ALL THE UM F FOR ALL OUR DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE THE UM A ABSOLUTE UM DIALOGUE ACT NUMBERS FOR THE MEETING
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0260101_0260652 BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT WE ALL PRODUCE THE NUMBERS FOR EACH MEETING SEPARATELY
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0261331_0261734 YEAH BUT WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME PROGRAMME I THINK
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0261734_0262273 WOULD PREVENT US FROM HAVING TOO MUCH MISTAKES IN IT
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0262273_0262641 OR AT LEAST UH THE MISTAKES WOULD BE CONSISTENT
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0265500_0265652 NO IT'S NOT REALLY DIFFICULT
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0265652_0265692 IT'S JUST
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0266495_0266594 YEAH I MEAN I CAN DO IT
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0266594_0267656 I CAN READ IN THE DIFFERENT UM IMPORTANCE MEASURES AND THEN RE RE CALCULATE THE NUMBERS
AMI_EN2001d_H00_FEO066_0298454_0298474 MM
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0003729_0003786 OKAY

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0006332_0006859 NO I'M JUST LIKE SORT OF LIKE PREPARING PEOPLE FOR UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE REALLY NOTHING
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0006859_0007179 IT LOOKS LIKE BASICALLY LESS THAN N TH THEIR STUFF
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0007179_0007709 BUT ACTUALLY DAVE HAS WRITTEN A WHOLE UNDERLYING DIFFERENT STRUCTURE NOW AND IF WE HOOKED IT UP WITH MY DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0007709_0008260 THEN WE SHOULD FAIRLY EASILY FROM NOW GET TO A STAGE WHERE WE CAN LIKE SELECT INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS AND CLICK ON THEM
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0008260_0008734 THEN PLAY THAT PART IN A COMPRESSED WAY AND DISPLAY DENSITY INFORMATION
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0008734_0008998 NOW AT THE MOMENT THE APPLICATION IS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0009240_0010094 YES SURE BUT SO AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE A DIALOGUE ACT WINDOW AND A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY W I'M NOT SURE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0010094_0010974 NO THE INTERESTING THING IS THE SOUND CAME WHEN I TRIED IT LAST TIME AFTER I I TRIGGERED OFF SOMETHING BY CLICKING ON SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0010974_0011106 YEAH THERE SUDDENLY THEY COME

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0011588_0011915 SO AT THE MOMENT THE DISPLAY IS STILL DIS COUPLED FROM IT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0011915_0012523 IT'S LOADING YOUR DATA I'M NOT QUITE SURE IS THIS IT PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE VERA'S DATA FROM FROM THE LOOKS OF IT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0012759_0013224 YEAH THE SEGMENTS ARE MADE UP AT THE MOMENT BUT THE CODE'S THERE FOR INTEGRATING REAL SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0013224_0013882 AND THIS IS SUMMARISED BASED ON JUST VERA'S DATA AT THE MOMENT FROM SOME PART OF THE MEETING
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0013882_0014193 SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT LOADING THE WHOLE THING AT THE MOMENT YET PROPERLY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0014193_0014778 BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS IS SUMMARISED BASED ON I I REALISE I'M ALWAYS POINTING AT MY SCREEN AND YOU DON'T SEE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0014778_0015336 SO THIS STUFF IS SUMMARISED BASED ON ON THESE INTENSITY MEASURES
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0015336_0015603 AND WE DON'T HAVE THE EXACT AUDIO RECORD FOR THIS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0015603_0015768 USUALLY SAY WE SHOULD HAVE JUST COPIED IT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0015768_0016470 SO JUST TO SHOW DAVE HAS PUT A UH MUSIC FILE IN THERE AND THE MUSIC FILE IS PLAYING WITHOUT GAPS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0016470_0016998 THAT'S BECAUSE THE WAY HOW WE HANDLE IT AT THE MOMENT IS THAT DAVE PREPARES AN AUDIO FILE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0016998_0017639 CREATES AN AUDIO FILE DYNAMICALLY FROM JUST THE CHUNKS THAT WE WANNA HAVE AND THAT RUNS IN SYNCH WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN THE

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0039204_0039289 UM
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0039489_0039762 WE HAVE TO GET THESE BUTTONS DAVE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0040443_0040512 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0041212_0041697 UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T GET THE THE BAR ON THE DISPLAY WORKING JUST YET
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0041697_0041822 BUT THAT SHOULD BE A SMALL ISSUE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0042711_0042819 YEAH I KNOW THIS IS VERY OLD
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0042819_0043484 WE JUST NEVER BOTHERED TO UPDATE THE STUFF BECAUSE WE WERE WORKING ON SO WE SEE THAT WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT DENSITY CURVE AS WELL FOR THIS ONE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0043673_0043738 AND
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0043937_0044418 YEAH SO FROM HERE WE GO AND IT HOPEFULLY WON'T BE TOO DIFFICULT TO NOW FIRST OF ALL PUT THE RIGHT SEGMENTS IN
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0044418_0044724 PUT A SLIDING BAR INTO THIS SO THAT PEOPLE SEE WHERE THEY ARE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0044724_0045011 SO I'M UH I'M I'M CONSTANTLY TOUCHING STUFF ON MY SCREEN I REALISE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0045011_0045420 AND AND THEN MAKE SELECTIONS BASED ON A SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0045420_0046043 NOW WHAT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE IS WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR LIKE HOW THE SUMMARISER WORKS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0046043_0046572 SHOULD IT ALWAYS COMPRESS A SEGMENT TO A CONSTANT LENGTH THOUGH BY A CONSTANT FACTOR OF TIME
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0046572_0046603 OR
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0047045_0047751 WHAT WOULD YOU THINK SORT OF IF YOU KNOW IF IF THERE'S A CERTAIN DEGREE OF OF SUMMARISATION WHAT SHOULD BE THE CONSTANT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0048122_0048232 SO ALWAYS LIKE A
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0048232_0048491 SO IT SHOULD ALWAYS WHATEVER REDUCE IT TO HALF THE ORIGINAL
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0048843_0049061 'CAUSE AN AL LIKE AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW WOULD BE THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0049272_0049337 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0049337_0049573 YEAH WELL I GUESS THAT COULD BE UH ADAPTABLE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0049573_0050024 'CAUSE AN AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW WOULD BE THAT YOU COULD SORT OF MAKE IT THAT IT ALWAYS IS THE SAME LENGTH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0050024_0050415 SO IF YOU LIKE IF THE WHOLE MEETING IS SELECTED IT COMPRESSES THE WHOLE MEETING TO FIVE MINUTES
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0050415_0051294 THEN IF ONE UM SEGMENT UH W ONE TOPIC IS SELECTED THEN IT PLAYS THIS WHOLE TOPIC IN FIVE MINUTES
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0051294_0051963 BUT THAT'S SORT OF THAT GIVES PEOPLE A BIT LESS CONTROL OVER SO MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT INSTEAD THAT IT YEAH IT C IT YOU CAN SPEC
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0052703_0052888 YEAH

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0060432_0060473 OKAY

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0070278_0070791 EVEN IF IT PAUSES FOR TEN SECONDS WELL THAT'S TOUGH LUCK THEN
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0070791_0070867 UH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0070867_0071593 THINK WE SHOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT IF IT TAKES QUITE SOME TIME THAT THAT THE CLOCK DOESN'T START BEFORE OR THAT THE AUDIO AND THE CLOCK ARE IN SYNCH SORT OF

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0073000_0073127 I THINK
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0073127_0073159 YEAH

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0076596_0076952 SO WE'RE F UH BEFORE THE PRESENTATION OF THE PROTOTYPE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0076952_0077140 WHICH I CAN WORK A LOT LOT LOT ON THIS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0077140_0077346 SO THAT'S GOOD
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0077346_0077412 UM
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0080122_0080457 YEAH WELL THE GRAPHIC DISPLAY WILL DEFINITELY HAVE MORE INFORMATION
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0080457_0081542 UM IF WE'RE AT THE MOMENT ABANDONING ABANDONING THE CONCEPT OF DISPLAYING THE WHOLE SERIES OF MEETINGS JUST BECAUSE IT'S FOR US LIKE MORE BUREAUCRACY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0081542_0081950 MORE COMPLEXITY AND IT PROBABLY JUST WON'T GIVE US ANY BROWNIE POINTS IN THE PRESENTATION
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0081950_0082110 OR DO YOU THINK IT WILL I MEAN DO YOU THI LIKE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0084399_0084417 I C
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0084941_0084978 WE'RE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0085126_0085325 AS ONE MEETING YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0085325_0085705 YEAH AND THEN MAYBE HAVE SOME BASIC INFORMATION
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0085705_0085761 LIKE IF
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0086752_0086796 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0086796_0087268 SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE DISPLAY THAT KNOWS WHERE MEETINGS PICKING IT OVER
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0087268_0087740 AND OTHERWISE INTERNALLY WE TREAT IT LIKE SO WE HAVE CONTINUOUS I. D. S FOR THE SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0087740_0087824 YEAH THAT WORKS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0088529_0089022 YES BUT APART FROM THAT WE DON'T REALLY DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT AS IF IT WAS JUST ONE MEETING
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0089022_0089144 YEAH I COMPLETELY AGREE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0089144_0089741 SO THE ONLY THING IT WOULD BE THAT THE DISPLAY GETS INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE AND DISPLAYS THEM AS HARD BOUNDARIES
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0090969_0091049 UM
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0091362_0092327 YEAH SO THE INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF MORE A SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY UM THAT SIMPLY THERE'S ONE BUTTON THAT SAYS FIND SIMILAR SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0092327_0092679 AND THEN IN THE SAME DISPLAY WHERE WE DISPLAY THE SEARCH RESULTS FROM THE SEARCH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0092831_0092846 WHA
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0093158_0094121 WELL I'M NOT SO YOU THINK DISPLAYING UH LIKE AN INFORMATION ABOUT SIMILARITY TO THE SELECT UH LIKE TO A SELECTED MEETING IN TO A SELECTED SEGMENT IN THE OTHER SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0095251_0095745 NO NO I THINK THAT'S I REALLY DON'T WANNA DO THAT TO BE HONEST
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0095745_0095956 UM IT WOULD BE NICE BUT LIKE JUST
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0096544_0097255 YEAH BUT I IT IT SHOULD APPEAR AS A CONTINUOUS THING F FOR THE YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0097255_0097498 BUT I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S WORTH MUCH BOTHER THOUGH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0097498_0097751 LIKE IF WE DO A S LIKE A SIMILARITY SEARCH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0097751_0098324 AND JUST LIKE YOU SAY FIND ME SIMILAR SEGMENTS AND THEN SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE A LIST AND YOU CLICK ON ONE OF THEM AND THEN YOU GO TO THAT SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0098324_0098973 I THINK THAT'S QUITE USEFUL UM EVEN WITHOUT DISPLAYING THEM SORT OF DIS CONTINUOUSLY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0099260_0100157 WELL I WAS THINKING OF JUST LIKE REALLY JUST A M MORE OR LESS JUST IMAGINE THOSE ARE SEARCH RESULTS EACH LIKE EACH OF THEM SORT OF THEM SORT OF GIVING WHATEVER
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0100157_0100741 WE SHOULD AIM TO GET SOME NAMES FOR SEGMENTS LIKE JUST SOME EXTRACTION OF SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CALL
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0100741_0101546 AND IF IT'S JUST THE SINGLE HIGHEST UM IMPORTANCE MEASURE O PHRASE OF A SEGMENT SO THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DISPLAY FOR THEM
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0101546_0101801 LIKE BASICALLY JUST A SUMMARISATION DOWN TO ONE SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0101801_0102255 AND IT WOULD JUST BE A LIST LIKE THIS AND YOU CLICK ON ONE AND THEN W YOU THO YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0102255_0102656 THEN THE WHOLE BUREAUCRACY KICKS IN LIKE THIS GETS THE NOTA NOTIFICATION THIS GETS THE NOTIFICATION
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0103049_0103589 AND THEN WE COULD LIKE WE COULD SORT OF USE THE SAME THING FOR UM YOURS AND MINE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0103589_0104104 BECAUSE YOURS WOULD SORT OF GIVE JUST THE SEGMENT I. D. S AND MINE WOULD GIVE THE START SEGMENT I. D. S
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0104518_0105096 SO BASICALLY THIS DISPLAY WOULD HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT A SEGMENT WHERE SOMETHING STARTS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0105096_0106094 MAYBE SE WELL MAYBE ALSO SOMETHING WHERE SOMETHING ENDS LIKE FOR MINE AND SOME STRING THAT WE PASS TO DESCRIBE WHAT LIKE WHAT IT IS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0106094_0106249 YOU WAIT YOUR SEARCH WHAT WOULD IT RETURN
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0106249_0106594 WOULD IT RETURN JUST THE SPECIFIC LIKE IT WOULD GO RIGHT TO THE UTTERANCE RIGHT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0107320_0107506 YEAH SURE SURE SURE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0107506_0107717 UM YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0107717_0108459 SO IN IN YOUR CASE LIKE IT WOULD BASICALLY WOULD PROBABLY SAY THE UTTERANCE HERE OR AT LEAST SOME PART OF THE U YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0108459_0109153 AND IN MY CASE IT WOULD SAY SOME NAME FOR THE SEGMENT AND THEN YOU WOULD JUST CLICK ON IT AND THEN LIKE THE WHOLE THING WOULD KICK IN
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0109153_0109627 LIKE YOU C YOU CLICK ON IT AND AND THE SELECTION MOVES AND THE DISPLAY GOES TO THAT PART
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0110485_0110535 YEAH

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0122883_0122915 MY C
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0123120_0123924 UH APPARENTLY MICROSOFT SOMETIMES OR LIKE AT LEAST IN THE PAST THE DEMONSTRATIONS WHERE THEY JUST EXACTLY KNEW WHICH FIVE PERCENT OF THE SYSTEM WERE WORKING
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0123924_0124210 AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AS WELL
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0124210_0124536 HAS ANYONE EVER SEEN ANYTHING FROM THE OTHER GROUP

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0126875_0127380 IF ANYTHING WE BUILD IN A TIME BOMB THAT ONLY FAILS IF THE DATE IS THE DATE OF THE PRESENTATION
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0127741_0127889 YES BECAUSE WE ARE NICE PEOPLE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0128130_0128388 DAVE THIS RATE THING DO WE HAVE ANY DIRECT CONTROL TO THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0128388_0128840 OR IS THAT JUST DIRECTLY CONTROLLING HOW FAST IT PLAYS AND SORT OF WE CAN ONLY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0129419_0129679 THAT'S A PITY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DOING SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0130211_0130244 'KAY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0131009_0131589 UM DO YOU THINK IF WE OVERRIDE THEIR COMPONENT AND JUST OVERRIDE WHATEVER THE THE ACTION TO THAT SLIDE BAR IS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0134521_0134957 SO IF SO SOMETHING LIKE THEIR SKIPPING WOULD IT ACTUALLY CORPORATE WITH OUR SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0134957_0135149 WOULD OURS SKIP AUTOMATICALLY FORWARD
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0135476_0135560 YEAH I REALISE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0137482_0137574 YEAH WHATEVER
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0138370_0139106 I THINK THIS SIMPLE THIS SIMPLE ST VIEW THAT WE GET THAT YOU CAN JUST LIKE PASS THINGS INTO AND THEN CHECK WHEN THEY GOT CLICKED REALLY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0141341_0141616 WELL COULDN'T THE SUMMAR OH NO THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO OVERRIDE THOUGH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0142686_0142735 HMM
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0142735_0143361 BUT I IN A SENSE I MEAN IF WE SEE UH YEAH BUT LIKE PROBABLY THAT WOULD BE THE SAME THING THAT WE ALSO DISPLAY UP HERE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0143361_0143811 BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT HAVING LIKE SOME BUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY EVEN BE SHORTER THAN FIVE LINES
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0143811_0144755 LIKE REALLY JUST GETTING I THINK GETTING ONE OR TWO BEST UTTERANCES FOR EACH SEGMENT WOULD BE REALLY WORTHWHILE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0144755_0145235 FOR THE SEARCH RESULTS I PROBABLY THINK THAT INSTEAD OF A P A SIMPLE SUMMARY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0145235_0145813 SOMETHING THAT DISPLAYS THE UTTERANCE WHERE THE WHERE THE WORD WAS LIKE DISPLAYS IN A HIGHLIGHTED FORM WHERE IT WAS FOUND
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0146595_0146766 TO TO APPLY WHAT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0148194_0148780 WELL ALTERNATIVELY WE COULD ALWAYS HAVE SORT OF A THIRD SMALL COMPONENT WHATEVER
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0148780_0148916 LIKE IF THIS WAS THE SEARCH RESULTS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0148916_0149469 AND THEN THEY ARE JUST LIKE SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S PART UNWRITTEN WHEN MILES GOES OVER THIS ONE IT TRIGGERS THAT ONE TO DISPLAY IT OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0149666_0149983 AND A TOOL TIP IS I THINK A VERY STRAIGHTF YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0149983_0150565 IT ESPECIALLY WITH A PREVIEW WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET TOOL TIP FAIRLY SIMPLE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A PROPERTY OF IT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0150565_0151073 UH I'VE NEVER SEEN TOOL TIPS DISPLAYING SEVERAL LINES AND STUFF THOUGH SO I WONDER HOW GOOD THAT'LL LOOK
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0151073_0151185 BUT WE'LL WE CAN TRY THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0151499_0151565 REALLY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0151565_0151865 WELL SO FAR ONLY SEEN TOOL TIPS OF FEW WORDS LENGTH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0151865_0152063 BUT YEAH UH THAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY EASY
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0153487_0153583 YEAH YEAH WE WILL HAVE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0153583_0153928 THAT'S ACTUALLY JUST GONNA HAPPEN TODAY AND WE WILL HAVE PROPER SEGMENTS AS WELL
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0154414_0154979 UM THE THING I REMEMBER LIKE I HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW TO DO IT WITHOUT REDRAWING THE DISPLAY EACH TIME
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0154979_0155233 BECAUSE THE DISPLAY AT THE MOMENT DOES TAKE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0155233_0156038 YOU SEE LIKE IT TAKES A FRACTION OF A SEGMENT TO DISPLAY BUT PROBABLY TOO MUCH TO UPDATE IT TO COMPLETELY REPAINT THE WHOLE THING EVERY SECOND

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0156542_0157011 I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT TO DO AND JUST REPAINTING THE THING AS A WHOLE WITH A MOVING BAR THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0157011_0157198 BUT UNTIL I THINK OF SOMETHING BETTER
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0157198_0157692 WHAT I'LL JUST DO IS I'LL JUST I'LL PROBABLY NOT HAVE A MOVING BAR THE WHOLE LENGTH BUT JUST SOME INDICATOR SOMEWHERE

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0202520_0203009 SO LIKE CREATING ONE FILE FOR THE WHOLE SERIES THAT GIVES THE UTTERA THE IDEAS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0203552_0203656 BUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0203656_0203679 IT

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0205794_0206030 WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN UH PRODUCE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0206030_0206541 LIKE I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR LIKE FOR ONE GROUP NOT FOR THE WHOLE CORPUS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0207967_0208062 NO NO N
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0208555_0208588 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0208742_0208778 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0209007_0209667 YEAH NO BUT DAVE UM YEAH SO THA THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING THAT LIKE THE SECOND MEETING SHOULD CONTINUE TILL THE FIRST ONE'S STOPPED

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0218379_0218575 YEAH SO IF I MEAN I DON'T MIND WHERE IT'S DONE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0218575_0219954 SO IF THE DATA MANAGER FILTERS IT OUT AND LIKE I JUST THINK THAT IN IN THE LOGIC OF THE PROGRAMME IT'S IT'S MUCH EASIER TO JUSTIFY WHY WE SAY WE TREAT A SERIES OF MEETINGS AS ONE SINGLE THING RATHER THAN W
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0221489_0221519 BUT A
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0223134_0223637 I B LIKE WOULD JUST I WOULD FIND LOGICAL REASONS FOR WHY YOU CAN SUGG SAY PEOP

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0291279_0291519 OKAY THE OTHER ONE IS JUST A STATIC DIALOGUE ACTS BOX
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0292099_0292217 OKAY

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0296723_0296922 BUT IS IT WORTH ANY EFFORT THOUGH I MEAN
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0297454_0297791 'CAUSE WE'LL NEVER HAVE MORE THAN TWO AND WE'LL NEVER HA WELL WE'LL EITHER HAVE ONE OR TWO
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0297791_0298669 SO IN THE END 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF WELL I GUESS YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0298669_0299196 BUT THEN ALSO WE'D HAVE TO FIND MORE SOPHISTICATED WAYS OF LOADING IT SPECIFYING THE PARAMETERS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0299196_0299298 SO THAT MIGHT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0299747_0300305 YEAH BUT THAT WE WOULDN'T SO WE'D HAVE TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE BOX FOR OPENING STUFF
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0300305_0300589 IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT TAKE HALF AN HOUR IN THE DISPLAY AND NOT MORE THAN THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0301260_0301306 HMM
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0301529_0301836 BUT IT MIGHT ACTU I THINK IT MIGHT NOT REALLY BE WORTH IT TO BE HONEST
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0302506_0302730 LET'S WORK ON THE OTHER STUFF FIRST LIKE THE OTHER STUFF
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0302730_0303935 AND JUST PROVIDE LIKE SOMETHING WHERE EACH OF THEM JUST IF IF THERE'S UH A JASMINE SCRIPT AND A VERA SCRIPT AND THEY EACH CAN LOAD THEIR STUFF AND SEE THEIR DATA IN IN THE THING
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0303935_0304557 THEY CA THEY EACH CAN SEE IT SUMMARISED BY THEIR DATA AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE STATIC ONE
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0304557_0304696 THAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY EASY TO DO RIGHT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0304696_0305171 IF I JUST DOUBLE THE DISPLAY AND YOU MAKE A UH LIKE A NON SYNCHED UP SECOND DIALOGUE ACTS
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0305344_0306035 AND YEAH AND THEN THEY CAN TUNE FINE TUNE THEIR MEASURES
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0306611_0307981 I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL IF WE COULD CHECK THE NITE CLOCK F CODE OR WHATEVER CODE IT IS FOR THIS COMPONENT AND SEE IF WE CAN ACCESS THOSE RATE THINGS AND AND DO SOMETHING USEFUL WITH THEM AND GET NOTIFIED WHEN THEY CHANGE AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0308722_0308785 YEAH I THINK
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0309006_0309132 YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0309132_0309905 SO THE THE THING IS IT'S PROBABLY AN EASY TASK TO READ THAT RATE BUT IT'S PROBABLY MORE DIFFICULT TO GET AN EVENT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN IT'S CHANGED
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0309905_0310302 SO THAT'S WHY WE MIGHT HAVE TO EXTEND NITE CLOCK AND LIKE OVERRIDE THE FUNCTION THAT REACT TO THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0310302_0310800 OR LIKE THE RATE IS PROBABLY A PROPERTY WHICH IN THE WORST CASE WE'D HAVE TO SET PUBLIC
AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0310800_0311252 BUT IF WE WANNA REACT TO IT BEING CHANGED AUTOMATICALLY WE MIGHT HAVE TO

AMI_EN2001d_H01_MEO069_0312946_0313365 I MEAN IT SHOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF CHANGING ONE SINGLE METHOD IN IT

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0054388_0055150 OKAY SO I'LL NEED TO DO SOME CHANGES TO PROGRAM MANAGER TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE UM CHANGING RESULTS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0056067_0056185 WHAT KIND OF INDEX
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0056812_0057015 TAKE AND MAKE THEM IN A HASH MAP OR SOMETHING

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0058894_0059391 UM WELL FROM THE POINT OF US DEVELOPING IT IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0064366_0064684 UM WELL AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST A AN OLD FILE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0065015_0065260 IT'D PROBABLY BE YEAH BEST TO MAKE A COPY OF IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0065416_0065476 I'D HAVE THOUGHT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0066013_0066968 I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO UM THE SPEECH TOOLS THROUGH JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE 'CAUSE THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THEM IS HORRIFIC
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0066968_0067105 IT'S REALLY BAD
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0067105_0067519 SO I THINK I'M THINKING I'LL JUST WRITE OUT A SCRIPT AND DO IT WITH A SYSTEM CALL
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0068168_0068198 NOT YET

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0078106_0078665 'CAUSE ARE WE GONNA HAVE SOME KIND OF TREE VIEW TO REPRESENT THE MEETINGS AND STUFF

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0088841_0089006 I MEAN THAT'S QUITE A CHEAP WAY TO DO IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0095918_0096150 IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO DO IT IN THE SUMMARISER
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0096880_0097130 YEAH IT WILL STILL APPEAR CONTINUOUS ON THE DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0099005_0099208 SO HOW ARE WE GONNA DISPLAY THE SEARCH FOR THIS CORPUS

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0123036_0123155 SO I THINK WE PROBABLY SHOULD
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0124526_0124921 UH WE SHOULD TRY RUNNING THAT THING AGAIN SEE WHAT IT DOES NOW
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0124921_0125057 OR JUST DELETE OR BACK UP IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0125856_0126341 OH J SO I CAN PRINT OBSCENE MESSAGES IN THE BACKGROUND TO UM STANDARD OUTPUT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0128798_0128928 IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK VERY WELL
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0128928_0129375 IT'S CAPABLE OF SLOWING DOWN THE AUDIO BUT SPEEDING UP DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK AT ALL

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0132074_0132219 THIS THING IS REALLY BIZARRE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0132219_0132421 IT SLOWS IT DOWN A BIT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0132421_0132559 THE SPEED UP DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0132968_0133037 YEAH

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0139222_0140118 SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE QUITE COOL IS IF YOU COULD UM YOU KNOW LIKE SOME APPLICATIONS WHEN YOU OPEN A FILE YOU GET LIKE A LITTLE PREVIEW
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0140118_0140809 IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT DISPLAYS LIKE A FIVE LINE SUMMARY WHEN YOU YOU'RE ABOUT TO OPEN THE FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0141187_0141323 HMM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0141323_0141360 YEAH

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0142060_0142778 YEAH IT'D LOOK PRETTY AND I'M NOT CONVINCED YOU'D GET ANY KIND OF GOOD QUALITY SUMMARY OUT OF IT IN ONLY FIVE LINES
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0142778_0142810 BUT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0145971_0146623 ANOTHER QUITE GOOD THING MIGHT BE UM HOW ARE YOU DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT IS TO APPLY TWO TIPS TO THINGS IN JAVA
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0146623_0146718 I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0146890_0147551 'CAUSE WHAT WOULD BE QUITE COOL IS IF ON THIS SEARCH RESULT YOU COULD GIVE IT EACH ONE A TOOL TIP THAT HAD THE CONTEXT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0147551_0147932 LIKE THE UTTERANCE BEFORE THE UTTERANCE ITSELF AND THE UTTERANCE AFTER
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0147932_0148067 SO THAT WHEN YOU HOVERED OVER IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0149476_0149788 BUT YEAH IF WE CAN GET THE TOOL TIP WE SHOULD USE IT THOUGH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0149788_0149962 'CAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE QUITE EASY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0150454_0150563 YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0151194_0151550 UM IT'S QUITE COMMON IN LIKE SOME APPLICATIONS

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0158291_0158745 UM ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS JUST ONE VALUE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0158745_0159097 UM THE HEIGHT IT DOESN'T CHANGE IN VALUE DOES IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0159097_0160097 SO IF YOU JUST REMEMBER THE COLOUR THAT IT WAS LAST AT AND YOU RE DRAW A LINE BEHIND IT OF THAT COLOUR AND THEN THE NEXT ONE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0168316_0168621 NO RIGHT NOW IT PROBABLY WON'T BE THAT MUCH BENEFIT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0168621_0168793 RIGHT NOW IT PROBABLY WON'T BE MUCH BENEFIT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0171335_0171846 SO THIS IS THE COMPONENT BASED EVALUATION HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY ISN'T IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0171846_0172024 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0172024_0172774 OH SO THAT'S A BIT ANNOYING 'CAUSE LIKE IT'S MY HOPE WE COULD JUST GO COBBLE SOMETHING TOGETHER AND JUST SAY LOOK IT'S GREAT

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0176008_0176483 I THINK THEY DO 'CAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST UM SIXTY PERCENT OR ISN'T IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0176483_0176776 'CAUSE IT'S I THOUGHT THEY WERE THIRTY PERCENT EACH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0176960_0177066 ONLY TEN PERCENT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0177559_0177669 I THOUGHT THEY'RE THIRTY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0180035_0180074 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0180595_0181310 'CAUSE I THINK WE'D RAMPANTLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW LONG IT'D TAKE TO DO THE ACTUAL UH SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BIT

AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0186492_0186702 HE WENT ABOUT CODE M. L.
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0186702_0187083 I'M GONNA MAKE ONE FOR GUITAR TABLATURE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0187083_0187136 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0187136_0187388 BUT I I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BIT OFF MORE THAN I COULD CHEW
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0187388_0187516 SO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE QUITE HARD
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0187840_0188416 MM WELL TAB DOESN'T USUALLY HAVE MUSIC NOTATIONS JUST UM PITCH INFORMATION
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0188416_0188438 UH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0188707_0188841 SEE HOW FAR I GET ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0191341_0191470 MM YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0191470_0191752 WELL YOU CAN EASY ADD A COMMAND LINE PARAMETER
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0192625_0192656 MM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0193093_0193389 IT MAY EVEN RETURN A FILE DIRECTLY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0193389_0193436 POSSIBLE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0193978_0194063 PROBABLY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0194063_0194275 UM THE THING IS IT I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0194275_0194894 IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO CALL IT FILE OPEN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S IT'S MORE LIKE AN OPTION
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0195087_0195181 TO SET THE PAR
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0195541_0195786 BECAUSE IT READS EVERYTHING JUST FROM ONE FILE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0196733_0196764 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0198351_0198546 OH YEAH THAT DID HAPPEN ONCE BEFORE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0203058_0203250 OR EVEN JUST THE ENTIRE CORPUS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0203250_0203481 THAT'S WHAT UM COLIN'S FILE HAS GOT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0205062_0205105 DOES HIS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0205105_0205384 IT'S IT'S EASY TO LOAD THAT MUCH JUST TEXT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0206583_0207380 UH I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO GO FOR THE WHOLE CORPUS BECAUSE THE MEET THE UM THE I. D. S GONNA HAVE GAPS AND STUFF IN THEM OTHERWISE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0207380_0207976 AND IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO READ THROUGH THE LIST OF UTTERANCES WHEN YOU'RE COMPILING ALL THE DATA OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0208700_0208731 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0208959_0208992 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0210010_0210653 WELL A AT THE MOMENT THE MAIN DATA I THAT'S JUST UH UNIQUELY NUMBERED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0210842_0211548 WELL AT THE MOMENT FROM THE DUMP FILE IT'S JUST GOT THEM UNIQUELY NUMBERED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0211846_0211873 HMM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0212113_0212733 AND IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO DO THAT ANYWAY BECAUSE UM THAT MEANS YOU GOT MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH HOW YOU WANT TO GROUP THEM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0212733_0213384 AND ONE THING YOU REALLY DON'T WANT IS EVER TO HAVE TWO UTTERANCES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE THE SAME I. D.
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0214259_0214567 YEAH BUT THAT'S THE POINT OF THE DATA MANAGER IS TO MANAGE ALL THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0215708_0216082 IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY MUCH POINT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0216082_0216952 'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S GOT QUITE NICE PROPERTY THAT THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER ALSO COINCIDES WITH THE ARRAY INDEX NUMBER IN THE ARRAY OF DIALOGUE ACTS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0216952_0217042 WHICH IS QUITE NICE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0218042_0218291 WELL YOU COULD YOU COULD CHOOSE WHATEVER YOU WANTED
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0219862_0220200 BUT YOU MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN THE SAME SERIES EACH TIME
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0220200_0220758 YOU MIGHT WANT TO DISPLAY ALL MEETINGS THAT HAD A PARTICULAR PHRASE MENTION SAY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0220758_0221494 AND THOSE MIGHT NOT BE THE ONES THAT WE ENUMERATED AS ONE MEETING IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE CONFLICTING I. D. S AND THINGS LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0221494_0221694 WHEREAS THE DA IF YOU DO IT IN THE DATA MANAGER
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0221694_0222430 YOU CAN CONTROL ANY LOGIC LIKE THAT PROGRAMMATICALLY RATHER THAN DOING IT BY HAND AND SETTING IT IN STONE FOR ALL TIME
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0223592_0223727 WELL IT'S JUST GOOD PRACTICE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0223727_0223965 LIKE IT SEPARATES THE DATA FROM THE PROGRAMME LOGIC
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0223965_0224314 WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING IS EMBEDDING SOME OF THE PROGRAMME LOGIC IN THE DATA
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0225119_0225484 YEAH BUT THAT'S A DECISION WE'RE FORCING ON THE USER WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0227456_0227588 YEAH I DON'T SEE WHY NOT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0229677_0229711 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0229923_0230286 I THINK IT SH EVERYTHING SHOULD BE LIKE THAT CONTINUOUS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0232733_0232942 I'M NOT SURE I HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT THE DATA
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0233469_0233717 IF THERE'S NO VALUE I GUESS YOU HAVE TO PUT A ZERO IN
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0234407_0234444 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0235173_0235434 WELL IT MIGHT BE MORE SENSIBLE TO ASSIGN IT AN AVERAGE VALUE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0236703_0237031 WELL WE'D W ONLY USE F. ZERO WHEN IT WAS PRESENT THOUGH WOULDN'T WE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0237231_0237508 WE WELL WE'D WANT TO USE F. ZERO WHEN IT'S PRESENT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0239459_0239498 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0240163_0240540 YEAH IN THE SUMMARISER IT'D BE THE UH IDEAL PLACE TO DO THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0242755_0243198 YOU COULD USE UM RED GREEN AND BLUE TO DISPLAY UP TO THREE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0247607_0247786 WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT IN JAVA
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0247786_0247816 BUT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0248113_0248415 THE TROUBLE IS THAT HUE ISN'T A VERY SENSIBLE SCALE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0248415_0248912 LIKE IT COMES UP TO LIKE RED TWO OR THREE TIMES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0249966_0250275 OR YOU COULD JUST SPLIT IT INTO TWO BLOCKS I SUPPOSE FOR NOW
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0252215_0252250 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0253781_0254276 WELL THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT CAN'T SWAP MEETINGS AT THE MOMENT IF THE DATA'S THERE FOR IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0254957_0255327 YEAH THAT'S MOST SENSIBLE WAY TO DO IT I THINK
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0256352_0256907 YEAH THAT'S WELL IT'S NOT READING THAT IN YET BUT THAT WILL BE PART OF THE DATA MANAGER AS WELL
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0256907_0257123 LIKE THERE'S ACCESS CLASSES ALL DEFINED FOR THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0257290_0257406 YEAH IT'S IN YOUR FILE ISN'T IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0257721_0257991 'CAUSE EACH UTTERANCE HAS GOT AN I. D. ASSOCIATED WITH IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0260102_0260167 I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0260742_0261184 SO JUST KEEP YEAH JUST ENUMERATE UP FOR THE NEXT NUMBER
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0261184_0261223 THREE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0274033_0274761 WELL THAT'S WHAT I MEANT IS IT'S A BIT POINTLESS HAVING IT AS FILE OPEN 'CAUSE IT WILL BE OPENING THOSE FILES ALL THE TIME
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0274761_0275203 IT'S MORE SENSIBLE TO HAVE IT AS AN OPTION AND THE LOCATION OF THEM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0275203_0275683 OR JUST SO YOU CAN CONFIGURE THE THE LOCATION OF ALL THE FILES AS AN OPTION
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0275683_0276048 BUT WHEN IT STARTS UP IT SHOULD JUST READ THEM FROM THE DEFAULT PLACE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0276778_0276887 YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0277336_0278440 OH OF COURSE T THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T MAKE A DEVELOPMENT VERSION THAT DISPLAYS BOTH HAS TWO WIN UTTERANCE WINDOWS AND UH TWO GRAPHICAL DISPLAYS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0278440_0278748 I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU IT'D HAVE TO PICK WHICH ONE TO SYNCH THE CLOCK TO
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0279064_0279347 TO ADD ANOTHER DIALOGUE ACT WINDOW IS REALLY EASY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0280563_0281312 OH LIKE SAY IF YOU COULD MAKE A UM CHANGE TO YOUR THING SO IT COULD DISPLAY UH LIKE IT IN TWO HALVES
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0281312_0281686 SO LIKE THE TOP HALF ONE THE BOTTOM HALF THE OTHER
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0281686_0281883 OR MAYBE THREE ACTUALLY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0281883_0282606 MAYBE TOP HALF ONE BOTTOM HALF THE OTHER AND THE THIRD ONE AN AVERAGE THAT WE CAN CHANGE THE PARAMETERS FOR
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0283083_0283520 AND THEN YEAH I COULD EASILY MAKE IT THROW OUT THREE DIFFERENT DIALOGUE ACTS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0283948_0284373 NO I'D JUST HAVE TWO OF THEM NOT SYNCHED UP BECAUSE IT'S JUST FOR EVALUATING THE DATA
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0285589_0285995 OH RIGHT YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0285995_0286200 OH NO NO IT'S STILL GOOD BECAUSE UM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0286472_0286644 OH NO IT ISN'T
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0286644_0286755 YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0286908_0286961 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0287907_0287988 YEAH I SUPPOSE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0288527_0288807 NO HOLD ON YOU IT WOULDN'T NEED THREE INTERNAL TIME SCALES
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0288807_0289438 'CAUSE ONLY ONE'S SYNCHED TO THE CLOCK OR IT C AND THE OTHERS ARE ALL ABSOLUTE REAL TIME AREN'T THEY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0289438_0289933 THAT'S WHAT'S DISPLAYED ON THAT THE BAR IS REAL TIME ISN'T IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0289933_0290118 SO THEY WOULD ALL BE IN THE SAME TIME SCALE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0291100_0291502 NO NO ONLY ONE OF THEM SYNCHS AND TWO OF THEM ARE JUST YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0291695_0291801 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0291801_0292165 THEY SYNCH UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF EVALUATING THE DATA
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0292745_0292803 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0292803_0293009 I MEAN NOT IN THE FINAL VERSION JUST FOR NOW
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0293466_0293501 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0294680_0295142 HOW EASY WOULD IT BE TO MAKE IT SO YOU CAN ADD ARBITRARY NUMBERS OF THEM DO YOU THINK
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0295362_0295658 NO LIKE UH DIFFERENT MEASURES TO THE DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0296870_0297248 WELL THAT'S THE THING IF IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN LIKE AN HOUR OR SOMETHING IT'S NOT WORTH IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0297645_0297690 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0299025_0299055 MM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0299260_0299710 BUT THAT'S EASY 'CAUSE MINE CAN TAKE UH ANY NUMBER OF PARAMETERS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0300638_0301296 MINE I'LL NEED TO MAKE A MINOR ADDITION TO THE DATA MANAGER AND THE SUMMARISER
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0301296_0301567 BUT IT'S MORE OR LESS READY TO GO WITH THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0304457_0304497 OKAY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0304666_0304685 YEP
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0304931_0304962 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0305343_0305447 YEAH SHOULD BE EASY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0308047_0308410 WE COULD JUST MAKE THAT RATE BE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0308410_0309036 JUST DISCONNECT IT FROM WHATEVER IT'S DOING AND THEN HAVE THAT SET THE LENGTH OF THE SUMMARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0310383_0310414 MM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0311215_0311566 WELL IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T REACT TO IT BEING CHANGED AUTOMATICALLY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0311566_0312138 IT ONLY REACTS WHEN YOU PRESS PLAY AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0312138_0312442 SO YOU HAVE TO STOP IT AND START IT TO MAKE ANY EFFECT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0313326_0313359 MM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0313518_0314069 YEAH I MEAN JUST DISCONNECT IT FROM WHATEVER IT SENDS THE MEDIA PLAYER AND CONNECT IT UP TO OUR SUMMARISERS
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0314069_0314218 THAT MAKES DIFFERENT LENGTH SUMMARIES
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0314413_0315380 'CAUSE LIKE WE COULD MAKE THAT NOT EVEN HAVE LIKE A A REAL SORT OF MEANING JUST PUT LIKE MAX AND MIN
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0315380_0316224 AND THE USER CAN JUST LIKE SET IT IN BETWEEN WHEREVER THEY WANT THE UH WITHOUT ACTUALLY TELLING THEM WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0317063_0317102 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0317681_0318064 WE SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE AWAY THE LABELS THAT SAY MINUS FOUR TIMES AS WELL
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0318222_0318398 'CAUSE THAT'S INCREDIBLY UNINTUITIVE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0321060_0321127 WELL
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0321444_0322092 BUT IT WON'T MAKE ANY HUGE CHANGES LIKE IT'LL ALWAYS HAVE THE EF THE ABILITY TO READ THE ORIGINAL ONES
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0322092_0322393 BUT IT MIGHT BE QUITE COOL TO HAVE A COMBINED MEASURE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0322393_0323080 LIKE JUST A WEIGHTED AVERAGE IS PROBABLY THE MOST SENSIBLE WAY TO ABOUT IT AND POSSIBLY THRESHOLDING IT
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0323636_0324079 NO IT JUST TAKES THE TOP LIKE TWENTY OR FIFTY OR HOWEVER MANY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0324271_0324307 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0325880_0326290 UM WELL I WAS GONNA GO TO THE GYM AT ABOUT THREE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0326290_0326436 SO
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0326868_0327281 OR TO BE HONEST LIKE IT'S MUCH QUICKER FOR ME TO GET STUFF DONE ON MY OWN
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0327281_0327941 IT'D MAKE MORE SENSE FOR US TO DIVIDE UP SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS DIVIDING UP TASKS AND THEN DO THEM SEPARATELY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0328531_0328764 WELL IT'LL BE AFTER FOUR THEN
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0328764_0328962 'CAUSE I'M GONNA GO AT THREE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0328962_0329011 THE GYM
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0330196_0330291 OKAY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0330291_0330586 SO MEET SAY FIVE TILL SEVEN THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TIME
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0330922_0331320 BECAUSE YEAH IT'S MUCH QUICKER IF WE'RE BOTH WORKING SEPARATELY I THINK
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0331320_0331764 'CAUSE WHEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER LIKE I'VE JUST NOT GOT A LOT DONE
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0331764_0332275 AND LIKE WHEN I GO HOME I'LL SPEND LIKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AND GET LOADS DONE IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0333268_0333363 YEAH OKAY
AMI_EN2001d_H03_MEE067_0333945_0333983 OKAY

AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0037805_0037821 MM
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0047841_0048099 MM I SUPPOSE IT SHOULD DEPEND ON THE LENGTH OF THE SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0048371_0048590 MM I GUESS THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0050278_0050320 HMM
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0052709_0052736 HMM
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0053329_0053550 YEAH I WAS WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THE SEARCH
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0053855_0053941 YEAH
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0053941_0054179 YEAH I'M QUITE KEEN TO DO LIKE MOST OF THAT
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0054179_0054505 LIKE MAKE AN INDEX SEARCH AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0054974_0055905 YEAH I THINK WHAT BASICALLY WHAT I NEED AT IS UM JUST A LIST OF WORDS WITH AN INDEX TO START WITH FOR EACH MEETING
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0056278_0057104 UM I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AS LONG AS THEY'RE UNIQUE AND IT CAN I CAN PASS 'EM BACK TO YOU AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO THE DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0057104_0057291 UM YEAH PROBABLY
AMI_EN2001d_H04_MEE068_0058279_0058337 YEAH

AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0236258_0237065 SO UM I WAS THINKING PERHAPS AT LOOKING UM AT THE UM ACOUSTIC MEASURES I HAVE
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0237065_0237548 SO FOR EXAMPLE AT MY F. ZERO UM DEVIATION
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0237548_0237719 BUT UM YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0237719_0239363 BY NOW I JUST HAD A LOOK AT THE YEAH DATA UM AND ACTUALLY THE AVERAGE F. ZERO DEVIATION IS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER FOR THE POSITIVE ONES THAN FOR THE NEGATIVE ONES
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0239363_0240112 I MEAN THERE IS A P DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO REALLY MAKE USE OF IT
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0240112_0240676 BUT I PERHAPS INVESTIGATE SOME TIME STILL TO
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0241319_0241371 YEAH

AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0243234_0243577 BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE THRESHOLD

AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0243953_0244337 YOU HAVE IT ALSO WITH WORDS THAT ARE MUCH HIGHER RANKED
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0244337_0245423 YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WITH YEP IS MUCH HIGHER RANKED BECAUSE IT OCCURS LESS OFTEN UM IN THE TRAINING THING
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0246063_0246134 NO
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0246134_0246411 UM IT'S ONLY IF THEY'RE USED IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS

AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0263433_0263740 BUT IT'S JUST TWO SPEAKERS AGREEING I THINK
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0263740_0264132 SAME FOR THIS ONE HERE FOR THESE TWO HERE
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0264408_0264685 I MEAN THEY THEY WILL BE OPTICALLY MERGED ANYWAY

AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0347992_0348080 MY COMPUTER
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0348080_0348287 UH IT DOESN'T HAVE LINU LINUX
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0348287_0348321 SO
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0353393_0353428 MM
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0355006_0355172 YEAH

AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0387106_0388181 AND YOU WOULD OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE TOO COMPLICATED TO COPE WITH THE THI UH SYSTEM IF YOU HAVE TO RE ADJUST IT UH TO A DIFFERENT ZOOM LEVEL TO GET BETTER RESULTS
AMI_EN2001e_H00_FEO066_0388181_0388559 I MEAN IT WOULD BEHAVE STRANGELY IN THE EYES OF THE USER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0000112_0000433 I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE BUT I'M NOT HAVING CRASHES AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0000433_0002091 SO WHAT I'M HAVING IS SO WE WE HAD A WE HAD A LONG PROBLEM ABOUT NOT FINDING OUT WHY THE TIME SYNCHING UP BETWEEN THE RELATIVE TIME IN IN A IN A SORT OF IN A IN A SUMMARISED SECTION AND THE ABSOLUTE TIME DIDN'T CORRESPOND AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0002091_0002345 AND WE FOUND IT WAS SOME STUPID WELL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0002345_0003136 AT THE MOMENT OUR BEST GUESS IS THAT IT WAS SOME STUPID JAVA THING ABOUT IF YOU IF YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE TWO OBJECTS AND YOU SAY OBJECT IF YOU SAY A. EQUALS B.
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0003136_0003389 THEY ACTUALLY REFERENCE TO THE SAME THING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0003389_0003754 SO ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO ONE ARE MADE TO THE OTHER AND IF YOU DO THAT AROUND FIVE CORNERS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0003754_0004064 YOU LOSE TRACK OF IT AND YOU SUDDENLY WONDER WHY THAT VALUE IS ZERO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0004064_0004714 AND IT TURNS OUT IT IS ZERO BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME THING THAT YOU ANYWAY UH SO WE FIGURED OUT IT'S INTERESTING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0004714_0005083 WHY DON'T I HAVE A SCREEN HERE NOW ACTUALLY THAT'S NEW BUT THAT'S OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0005083_0005205 IT'S DOING DIFFERENT THINGS ALL THE TIME
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0005205_0005613 LIKE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ACTUALLY THE BUT UH UH THAT SHOULD BE OKAY THAT SHOULD BE OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0005613_0005720 I'LL I'LL BE ABLE TO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0006395_0006853 YEAH BUT LAST TIME I PRESSED THAT KEY COMBINATION EVERYTHING WENT WRONG AND I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT JUST FINE ON THE SCREEN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0006853_0007481 SO THAT'LL PROBABLY KEEP ME FROM POINTING ON MY SCREEN WHICH I USUALLY IT MIGHT JUST BE AT THIS POINT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0007481_0007758 LIKE THERE'S SOMETIMES A POINT TO LOADING NOT USUALLY THAT LONG
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0007758_0007920 WELL LET'S SEE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0007920_0008216 ANYWAY SO N UH LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0008390_0008642 IN THE END WE DID GET IT WORKING BEFORE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0008857_0009247 OH SEE I GET YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0009247_0009334 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0009810_0010055 AH SO NOW I'M HAVING A COMPLETE MESS OF LIKE SPLIT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0010328_0010460 SPLIT SCREENS AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0010460_0010894 I THINK LAST TIME YES BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT IS IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0010894_0011830 SO BUT I THINK IF I THIS IS A LOG OUT COMMAND AND USUALLY IT RESETS THIS AMAZING STRANGE COLOUR COMBINATIONS I SEE IN FRONT OF ME AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0012309_0012762 YEAH WE SOMEHOW ALWAYS GET IT WORKING BUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS EVERY TIME
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0012762_0012822 UM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0013227_0014061 SO THAT KEPT US LIKE BASICALLY FROM DOING ANYTHING ELSE PRODUCT QU FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN THE LAST DAYS BECAUSE WE WERE UM HUNTING DOWN THAT STUPID ERROR
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0014061_0014410 I GOT IT FIXED IN THE LAST WHATEVER ONE HOUR OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0014410_0015084 BUT SO AT THE MOMENT THE PROGRAM IS SORT OF IN BETWEEN WORKING AND NOT WORKING BECAUSE WE'VE DONE LOTS OF CHANGES TO WHAT THE ERROR WAS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0015084_0015576 DAVE I THINK ACTUALLY THAT THE SUMMARY AT THE CURRENT MOMENT ISN'T WORKING A HUNDRED PERCENT CORRECT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0015576_0015807 BUT THAT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE INPUT DATA
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0015807_0016144 IT SEEMS TO JUST TAKE THE FIRST UTTERANCES MORE OR LESS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0016378_0017089 LIKE IF YOU IF YOU FIRST IF YOU READ THROUGH THE SUMMARIES THEY READ SUSPICIOUSLY FLUENT LIKE AS IN PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0017089_0017561 AND THEN IF YOU PLOT THEM ON THE SCREEN WHERE WHERE THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT THEY SEEM TO O
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0018466_0018731 YES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0018731_0018945 SO MAYBE THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS COMING FROM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0019118_0019186 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0019186_0019328 UM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0019547_0020075 SO THIS IS WHEN YOU START SHIFTING AROUND YOUR LAPTOP TO THINK THAT IT GETS SOMEHOW LESS SLOPED ON THE SCREEN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0020075_0020162 UM

AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0046644_0046667 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0046892_0047317 'CAUSE YOU'D RECKON THAT YOU COULD LEAVE THEM IN AND THEY WOULD NEVER SHOW UP IN A SUMMARY ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0050772_0051629 WE WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT IF WE JUST WRITE THE PROGRAMME THE WAY THAT EVEN IN THE P WAY THAT IT DISPLAYS EVERYTHING IT STILL LEAVES THOSE OUT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0051629_0052167 LIKE IF WE THOSE A SPECIAL INFORMATION DENSITY I. D. OR IF YOU JUST PUT A SPE YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0052167_0052774 AND THEN JUST MAKE SURE THAT SUMMARY EVEN IN THE IN THE MOST SUMMARISED MODE JUST NEVER PUTS THEM IN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0053429_0053479 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0056982_0057166 'KAY SHALL WE TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE CURRENT SYS

AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0062320_0062483 YEAH IT DID S IT DID SUMMARISE JUST NOW
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0062483_0062789 IT'S JUST IT'S SUMMARISING STUPIDLY BUT AT LEAST IT'S JUMPING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0062789_0062822 SHALL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0062986_0063367 YES AND IN FACT AT THE MOMENT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH OF THE TWO I'M SUMMARISING OVER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0063367_0064629 DO YOU KNOW Y ARE W ARE WE UM SO AT THE MOMENT THE CONFIGURATION IS THAT WORD IMPORTANCE FILE IS TEST THREE AND T. D. I. D. F. FILE IS TEST TWO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0064629_0064777 I'VE JUST I'VE JUST SWITCHED THEM AROUND
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0064777_0064963 SO I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0065170_0065741 YEAH ESPECIALLY SINCE I'VE JUST ESPECIALLY S SINCE I'VE JUST SWITCHED THEM AROUND ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0065741_0065815 BUT THAT'S OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0065815_0066398 I BY THE WAY I READ A PAPER WHICH MAKES AN IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT COMBINING TWO THINGS OF THAT TYPE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0066398_0067053 UM THAT'S BASICALLY IT'S IT'S T GOING ON ABOUT THIS FANCY CALLED GEOMETRIC MEAN WHICH EFFECTIVELY JUST MEANS MULTIPLYING THEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0067053_0067913 BUT I I HAVE SOME GOOD F INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS HOW YOU CAN SORT OF WEIGHT TWO DIFFERENT FACTORS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0067913_0068122 BECAUSE IT'S UH LIKE IT IT'S FOR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0068122_0068593 SOMEBODY WOULD TRY TO SOLVE A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM WHERE THEY ALSO HAD TWO FACTORS SORT OF AND THEY WANT TO WEIGH THEM TOGETHER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0068593_0069467 AND THERE IS LIKE A GOOD JUSTIFIABLE REASON UM WHY WE SHOULD DO IN A CERTAIN WAY AND HOW WE CAN THEN WITH A SIMPLE PARAMETER ADJUST HOW MUCH ONE WEIGHS AND HOW MUCH THE OTHER WEIGHS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0069467_0070129 SO THERE IS SOMETHING FOR JUST FOR PUTTING THEM TOGETHER IN A RELATIVELY SIMPLE WAY BUT STILL A WAY THAT WE CAN SORT OF JUSTIFY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0070229_0070484 UM AND WE CAN QUOTE STUFF ON THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0070484_0070670 YEAH SURE WE HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0070670_0071442 NO IT'S MULTIPLYING THEM AND AND LIKE PUTTING THEM ONE OVER THE POWER OF SOMETHING AND THE OTHER OVER MINUS ONE ONE MINUS THE POWER OF SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0071442_0072372 AND THAT'S SORT OF AND THEY THEY'VE PLOTTED SOME GRAPHS ABOUT LIKE WHERE THEY SHOW F LIKE ONE GOING FROM ZERO TO THE ONE AND THE OTHER GOING ZERO TO ONE AND LIKE HOW THE HOW THE LANDSCAPE CHANGES AND HOW I THE PARAMETER CHANGES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0072372_0072454 HOW IT WORKS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0072454_0072660 SO IT'S QUITE GOOD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0072660_0073735 UM SO THAT'S PROBABLY SEEING THAT WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA GO INTO ANY WHATEVER BASE BLAH BLAH BLAH MARKOV MODEL BLAH BLAH BLAH ABOUT F COMBINING THEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0073735_0074027 UM THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE GO AT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0074027_0074212 NOW THIS IS STILL NOT IDEAL AT THE MOMENT DAVE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0074212_0075112 IT'S IT'S SORT OF IT'S OVERRUNNING THE F LIKE IT SO OKAY SO AT THE MOMENT WE'RE THAT FAR THAT IF I NOW CLICK ONTO A SEGMENT HITS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0075275_0075774 YEAH IT'S JUST WAIT SORRY I JUST RE SIZED IT A BIT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0075774_0076282 YEAH SO IT'S J LIKE THE VALUES ARE SORT OF HARD CODED FOR THE SCREEN SIZES IN DICE AND MY SCREEN'S SMALLER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0076486_0077073 SO LET'S SEE I WAS A STUPID USER AND WAS CLICKING ON THIS SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0077073_0077265 WE PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SEGMENT LINES A LOT BIGGER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0077265_0077487 SO THEN I H I DID I GET A NEW SUMMARISATION
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0077487_0077565 YEAH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0077565_0077723 SO LET ME CHECK A DIFFERENT ONE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0077723_0077928 YEAH SO YOU SEE IT'S A DIFFERENT TEXT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0077928_0078176 AND YOU SEE IT IT'S RUNNING THROUGH IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0078176_0078516 AND ALSO YOU SEE THE INDICATOR IN WHERE WE ARE IS JUMPING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0078516_0078651 SO IT'S IT'S SKIPPING STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0078651_0079397 NOW I DON'T THINK THE SUMMARY AT THE MOMENT IS WHAT WE WANTED TO BE SEEING THE WORDS LIKE OH AND MM AND EXACTLY EXACTLY RIGHT SURE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0079397_0079669 THIS SEEMS PROBABLY SH THIS IS AGAIN PROBABLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE WANT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0079669_0080137 SO IT'S PROBABLY SOME VALUE THAT YOU HAVE TO LIKE DIVIDE BY ONE UH ONE DIVIDE BY THE VALUE OF SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0080137_0080280 BUT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0080709_0081513 YES BUT ALSO EVERY OTHER WORD IN THAT SENTENCE WE SHOULD LOOK AT ARE PROBABLY IN YOUR LIST OF FIFTY LIKE LIST OF ALL IMPORTANT WORDS IN THE UNIVERSE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0081513_0081949 SO YES BUT IT'S PROBABLY JUST BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0081949_0083037 LIKE THIS IS JUST THEIR BEST SENTENCE FOR LIKE HAVING FUNCTION WORDS IN A ROW SORT OF AND EVERY O OTHER I MEAN THIS ONE IS SORT OF THE DEVELOPING A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0083037_0083264 SO MAYBE IT'S JUST DOING IT RANDOMLY AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0083264_0083311 I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0083311_0083757 BUT WE HAVE SOME SUMMARY WORKING AND THAT'S A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0083757_0084212 IF I PROMISE NOW THAT YOU'LL GET SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN PUT YOUR OWN DATA AND THAT'S SORT OF RINGING A BIT HOLLOW
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0084856_0085082 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0085082_0085328 YEAH UH STILL IT'S UH IT IT'S MIGHT BE HAVING SOME PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0085328_0085527 I THINK THIS ONE OVER RAN JUST BEFORE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0085527_0086019 SO WE MIGHT STILL HAVE SOME PROBLEM HERE THAT IT'S NOT STOPPING AT THE END BUT SO DAVE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0086019_0086500 CAN YOU MAKE THE PROMISE EVEN I'M NOT MAKING THE PROMISE REALISTICALLY THAT THE GIRLS WILL VERY SOON GET
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0086896_0087012 OKAY YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0087405_0087614 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0087614_0087647 S
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0087856_0088610 S SO AT THE MOMENT I'VE HARD CODED IT TO JUST UM TAKING ONE TENTH OF THE NUMBER OF UTTERANCES WHICH WERE IN THE ORIGINAL SELECTION
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0088861_0088976 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0088976_0089447 IT ACTUALLY IT GIVES YOU AN ERROR IF YOU PUT IT TO TWENTY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME THINGS IN THERE WHICH ARE SHORTER THAN TWENTY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0089447_0089625 AND IF YOU SELECT THOSE THAN IT'S HAVING AN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0089862_0089990 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0089990_0090232 BUT I THINK LIKE A B A PROPORTIONAL ONE IS PROBABLY NOT BAD IDEA
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0090232_0090768 THAT'S BL I MEAN AN AN ABSOLUTE LENGTH IS SORT OF A BIT STRANGE BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT SOME UTTERANCES WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN LENGTH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0090768_0091191 I KNOW BUT WE HAD THAT DISCUSSION BEFORE AND I'M CONFUSED MYSELF ABOUT WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0091191_0091909 SO THE FACT THAT THIS IS GOING ON BEYOND THAT GREEN LINE HERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IDEAL BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO SORT OUT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0091909_0092216 BUT THIS IS WORKING IN GENERAL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0092216_0092924 DOES ANYONE HAVE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OVER THE WHOLE TIME ISSUE LIKE AS IN WHAT DATE IS IT TODAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0092924_0093607 WHAT DATE DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS PRESENTED WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK IS THAT AND ISSUES LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0093607_0094209 SO THE PRESENTATION IS NOW SH TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0094209_0094274 'KAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0094274_0095174 ONE WEEK FROM TODAY I SHALL HEAR THE FREEDOM RING FROM THE HILLS AND AND EVERYTHING AND SHALL THEN THROW MYSELF INTO NEW SLAVERY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0097104_0097195 AH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0097195_0097389 NO REALLY

AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0100220_0100379 WRITING THE REPORT WON'T BE SO BAD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0100379_0100539 HOW LONG IS IT EXPECTED TO BE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0100868_0101617 I KNOW BUT UH IF EVERYONE LIKE IF EVERYONE IS MANAGING THREE PAGES FOR THEIR BIT THEN THAT'S GONNA BE THAT THAT'S A BIG REPORT THEN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0101831_0101891 AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0101891_0102153 SO YEAH BUT EVALUATION
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0102153_0102172 AH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0102900_0102960 YOU THINK
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0103185_0103868 WE SHOULD PROBABLY INQUIRE ABOUT THAT OR LIKE INTEGRATE TOOL TIPS THAT WOULD BE VISIBLE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0106946_0107251 HAVING SAID THAT DAVE WE COULD PROBABLY W LIKE IF WE WANT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0107251_0107695 WE COULD PROBABLY GO BACK TO THE C UM TO THE GROUP DIRECTORY AND JUST USE THIS TRICK
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0107695_0108033 IT REALLY SEEMS TO BE ALL ABOUT STARTING IN THE DIRECTORY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0108033_0108433 BUT I MEAN IF IF THE TWO OF US ARE JUST WORKING ON IT IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE 'CAUSE I'VE ALREADY MOUNTED YOUR DIRECTORY NOW
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0108433_0108632 SO AND PROBABLY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0109183_0109208 MM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0114792_0114828 WHAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0115244_0115440 WELL IF IT'S JUST MULTIPLYING TO NUMBERS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0115440_0116211 IT CAN BE DONE IN THE PROGRAMME 'CAUSE THEN WE CAN UM BECAUSE WHAT WE COULD DO IS HAVE A SLIDE BAR WHERE WE CAN ADJUST THIS VALUE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0116211_0116899 ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY LIKE HOW BASICALLY A GENERAL WAY BECAUSE THERE'S AT LEAST TWO POINTS AT WHICH WE ARE INTERESTED IN THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0116899_0117510 HOW WE CAN JUST HAVE A SLIDE BAR WHICH WE CAN READ AND WRITE TO WHICH IS IN A FRAME OF THAT TYPE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0117510_0117558 THAT WOULD BE GOOD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0117558_0117658 IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT SHOULD IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0117658_0117746 I MEAN SHOULD JUST BE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0118099_0118492 YEAH BUT IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFI UH LET'S SEE IT YOU COULD IF YOU'RE LUCKY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0118492_0118755 YOU PROBABLY HAVE JUST TO EXTEND THAT CLASS AND THEN YOU CAN WORK WITH THAT VALUE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0118755_0119355 BUT IF YOU'RE UNLUCKY IT MIGHT BE QUICKER TO JUST WRITE A VERY SIMPLE STRING COMPONENT WHICH IS JUST THE S JUST A BAR
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0120447_0120574 YEAH YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0120574_0120941 SO BECAUSE WE'D BASICALLY IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ONES TO PLAY AROUND WITH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0120941_0121435 ONE FOR CONTROLLING THE LENGTH OF THE SUMMARY AND ANOTHER ONE FOR
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0121615_0122077 UM FOR THE MERGING FACTOR IF WE DO IT THAT WAY WITH THE CHI METRIC
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0122738_0122843 YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0122843_0123083 IT'S IT'S JUST A SINGLE FORMULA EFFECTIVELY YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0123083_0123407 UM HOW IS THE AUDIO THING GOING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0123407_0123641 IS THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY NOT HAD TIME TO WORK ON THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0124426_0124784 'KAY IT SEEMS THAT AT THE MOMENT A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT HAS TO BE DONE AT SORT OF AT THE MOMENT I'M SAYING OH DAVE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0124784_0124833 CAN YOU DO THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0124833_0124927 SO THAT'S NOT IDEAL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0125496_0125514 OH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0125872_0125927 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0126628_0127140 'CAUSE I THINK I MEAN THE AUDIO IS A V IN THE END THE AUDIO IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0127140_0127536 JUST BECAUSE IT'S IT'S GONNA LOOK STUPID IF WE HAVE EVERYTHING WORKING BUT JUST IF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0128153_0128253 THE SPEECH TOOLS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0128981_0129282 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0129282_0129569 IS THERE ANY WAY FOR X. FORWARDING SOUND
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0129897_0130600 'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE SORT OF THE NICE WAY TO SIT AT HOME AND HAVE IT FORWARD THE SOUND AT THE LOWEST BIT RATE TO YOU
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0130600_0131577 I MEAN SEEING THAT IT'S OVER BROAD BAND IT'S FORWARDING THE GRAPHICS QUITE OKAY IT WOULD PROBABLY LIKE BROAD BAND WISE BAND WIDTH WISE PROBABLY WORK OUT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0132103_0132443 BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT AND UH NOT A SIMPLE THING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0133719_0133739 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0134117_0134679 Y ARE YOU NOT CREATING FILES ANYWHERE LIKE SORT OF REAL FILES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0134679_0134947 SO THAT YOU CAN DO ON A DICE MACHINE INDEPENDENT OF W
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0136649_0136773 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0136773_0137658 ONE PROBLEM WITH S. S. H. ING IN GENERAL IS THAT THE MACHINE THAT LIKE ON THE ONLY GATEWAY MACHINES THEY HATE YOU FOR DOING ANYTHING ON THEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0137658_0138440 AND THERE'S NO SIMPLE WAY AT LEAST I HAVEN'T FOUND ONE TO DIRECTLY IN IN A SINGLE STEP SORT OF S. S. H. AND THEN S. S. H. AGAIN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0138779_0139300 WELL ACTUALLY I GUESS IF YOU PUT S. S. H. AND YOU KNOW C YOU CAN GIVE A COMMAND OUTRIGHT AFTER WITH S. S. H.
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0139300_0139980 SO IF THAT C COMMAND IS S. S. H. AGAIN AND IF YOU THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE ALL YOUR KEY FILES SET CORRECTLY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0139980_0140235 WHICH I HAVEN'T BECAUSE IT ALWAYS FUCKS UP ON MY SYSTEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0140235_0140580 MAYBE IF YOU GET THAT WORKING THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIRECTLY GO INTO ANOTHER MACHINE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0140747_0140772 UH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0141162_0141199 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0142066_0142131 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0142131_0142813 'CAUSE A P A PRIMITIVE VERSION OF THE SOUND TO HAVE RELATIVELY SOON WOULD BE GOOD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0142813_0142898 I THINK
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0143106_0143328 OK OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0143328_0143431 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0143431_0143580 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0143580_0143775 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0143775_0143909 OKAY GOOD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0143909_0144109 SO TO COME BACK TO THE PROBLEM WE HAD BEFORE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0144109_0145484 SO THE REASON WHY THE SUMMARY DIDN'T WORK WELL IN THE LAST ONE AND WORKS WELL NOW IS BECAUSE BASED ON THE BOTTOM DATA THE DATA IS SO HOMOGENEOUSLY HIGH IN ITS IMP IMPORTANCE RATING THAT IT JUST SORT OF THEN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0145484_0145787 EVERYTHING ELSE BEING EQUAL IT TOOK THE FIRST ONES MORE OR LESS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0145787_0146193 BUT NOW IT'S WORKING BETTER BECAUSE NOW IT'S ON A MUCH MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0147282_0147334 WELL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0147569_0148996 THE MOST PROFESSIONAL WAY OF DOING IT WOULD BE TO MAP THEM ACCORDING TO THE STANDARD DEVIATION 'CAUSE THAT WAY IT AU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ALWAYS THAT'S SORT OF LIKE IT IT'S THE PROBLEM IS IT'S MORE CALCULATION EXPENSIVE AND SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED EVEN THOUGH IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE IN TERMS OF CALCULATION IT'S NOT MUCH HEAVIER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0148996_0149193 BUT LIKE YOU KNOW GENERALLY ABOUT STANDARD DEVIATION
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0149340_0150093 YEAH IT'S IT'S A G IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SIMPLE FORMU IT'S BASICALLY JUST WHATEVER THE AVERAGE OF R MEAN SQUARE DIFFERENCES FROM THE MEAN OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0150093_0150661 WHICH THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT GENERALLY YOU FIRST HAVE TO GET THE MEAN AND ONLY T ONLY ONCE YOU HAVE THE MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0150915_0151038 IN ONE GO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0151038_0151366 YEAH I'VE DERIVED THAT I'VE DERIVED THAT MYSELF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0151366_0151645 LIKE I DIDN'T FIND IT SO I DID IT MYSELF AND IT TOOK ME A DAY WITH THE FORMULA
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0151645_0151772 BUT THEN I'M SLOW AT MATHS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0151772_0152098 SO THE THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT WOULD BE THAT IF YOU SIMPLY SAY THAT WHATEVER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0152098_0152722 ONE STANDARD DEVIATION BELOW THE MEAN IS ZERO AND ONE STANDARD DEVIATION ABOVE THE MEAN IS ONE OR TWO STANDARD DEVIATIONS OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0152722_0153020 THEN WHATEVER THE DATA IS LIKE IT WOULD ALWAYS NORMALISE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0153191_0153325 YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT THE SIMPLEST
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0153325_0153608 BUT THAT LIKE THAT'S THE MOST PROFESSIONAL WAY I CAN THINK ABOUT IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0153608_0153803 Y THAT WOULD INDIRECTLY ALSO DROP STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0153803_0154228 I MEAN THAT WOULD DROP WHATEVER IS BELOW OR ABOVE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0154228_0154497 SO IF YOU FIND THAT FORMULA THAT WOULD BE GOOD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0154497_0154797 OTHERWISE I CAN SEE IF I CAN STILL UNDERSTAND LIKE I DID IT IN MY PROGRAMME
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0154797_0154896 IT'S UH IT'S REALLY STUPID
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0154896_0155403 LIKE THE STANDARD STANDARD DEVIATION FORMULA JUST REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE THE MEAN INITIALLY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0155403_0155953 AND THAT MAKES SOME THINGS EXACTLY TWICE AS COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE AND THERE IS A WAY OF DOING IT CUMULA CUMULATIVELY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0156305_0156348 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0156682_0157102 SO YEAH SO THAT'S ONE POSSIBLE WAY OF DOING THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0157619_0157684 SO THE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0158375_0158582 AND THAT'S JUST IN THE LOADING STAGE RIGHT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0158582_0158919 YEAH THAT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE FINE ESPECIALLY IN THE WORST CASE WE JUST INTRODUCE A SMALL HOUR GLASS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0158919_0159667 BUT ANYWAY WE ONLY WE ONLY GONNA PRESENT THIS ONCE AND WE CAN PROBABLY JUST LIKE SORT OF START IT UP BEFORE THE PRESENTATION STARTS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0159667_0160076 SO IF WE SHOULDN'T AT ALL BE WORRIED ABOUT IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE BEAUTIFUL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0160076_0160429 IT'S LIKE IF YOU B WANT A PROGRAMME ONLY TO RUN ONCE AND ONLY A PART OF IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0160429_0160892 YOU DON'T WORRY IF IT CRASHES AFTERWARDS IF IT WASTES ALL THE RESOURCES IF IT FORMATS THE HARD DISK IN THE END
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0160892_0161016 ANYWAY I'M RAMBLING ON
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0161016_0161070 UM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0161307_0161487 NO IT DOES NOT IT DOES NOT IF Y I CHANGED IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0161487_0161540 I JUST
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0161805_0162444 SO YOU WOULD FORGET THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD START IT FIFTEEN TIMES OVER AND HAVE FIFTEEN ZOMBIES RUNNING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0162444_0162513 UM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0162713_0163380 DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHICH DICE MACHINES HAVE SOUND CARDS AND HOW TO FIND THEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0163380_0163878 'CAUSE THE THING IS WE CAN LIKE THIS AT THE MOMENT WOR IS WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS A SOUND CARD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0163878_0164505 THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S STRUCTURE OF THIS IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO JUST SAY WELL IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUND CARD YOU DON'T HAVE SOUND
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0164505_0164732 AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S WHAT I REMEMBER OUR PROBLEM WAS THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0164891_0164951 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0164951_0165086 NO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0165086_0165568 SO I'VE WORKED AROUND THAT THERE IS WAYS I THINK TO GET AROUND IT BUT THE PROBLEM IS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0165743_0165977 SO YOU B YOU BASICALLY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO CODE VERSIONS THEN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0165977_0166339 ONE FOR SOUND CARD AND ONE FOR NON SOUND CARD MACHINES TO TEST IT ON
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0166339_0166772 UM BECAUSE IT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUND CARD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0166772_0167354 SO THERE ISN'T A SIMPLE WAY TO JUST TELL WHICH ONES THE SOUND CARD MACHINES ARE AND JUST TO USE SOUND CARD MACHINES IS THERE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0167825_0167860 WE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0168197_0168688 NO BUT I GUESS I MEAN IF YOU JUST IF YOU TRUST IN DAVE'S SUMMARY FOR THE AUDIO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0168688_0169133 JUST PUTTING ALL THESE THINGS INTO SOUND THEN THEN HAVING A WRITTEN SUMMARY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0169445_0169550 YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0169550_0169782 SO THE YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0169782_0169826 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0169826_0170253 SO I THINK DAVE REALLY THE EASIEST WAY IS IF YOU JUST MAKE A SOUND CARD AND A NON SOUND CARD VERSION OF IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0170253_0170300 BECAUSE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0170571_0170866 YEAH BUT THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE GIRLS CAN'T TEST IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0170866_0170938 THAT'S THE PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0170938_0170968 LIKE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0171410_0172134 YES BUT WITHOUT THE CLOCK YOU DON'T HAVE WELL ACTUALLY YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOESN'T LIKE F IT DOESN'T STRICTLY HAVE TO DO ANY MOVEMENT IN IT YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0172705_0172973 YEAH BUT WE HAVE TO COMMENT STUFF OUT FOR THAT I THINK
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0172973_0173384 LIKE AT THE MOMENT IF YOU CLICK ON A SEGMENT IT AUTOMATICALLY SETS THE WHOLE CLOCK THING GOING AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0173384_0173537 SO WE HAVE TO COMMENT OUT STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0173537_0173877 SO THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING THAT THERE IS WE COULD MAKE IT THAT A FLAG COULDN'T WE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0173877_0174243 WE COULD JUST MAKE THAT UH LIKE A RUN TIME FLAG AND THEN MAKE A FEW IFS AND SAY IF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0174728_0174918 YES THE P THERE IS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0175391_0175454 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0175701_0175753 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0175753_0176706 SO ANYWAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE IT SEEMS JUST THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF DICE MACHINES DON'T HAVE SOUND CARD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0178318_0178634 NO NOTHING C MUCH TO TALK ABOUT THIS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0178634_0179186 SO APART FROM LIKE UH A SEARCH BOX AND THE SIMILARITY THING F ONCE THAT KICKS OFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0179186_0179542 W WHICH IS GONNA BE HORRIBLE BUT UM THIS IS MORE OR LESS IN THE END
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0179542_0179891 LIKE THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT OUR PRODUCT WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE END
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0179891_0180455 SEEING THAT REALISTICALLY WITH THE GIVEN TIME FRAME WE'RE NOT GONNA DO AMAZING NEW THINGS FROM NOW ON
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0180455_0180652 SO I MEAN WE'LL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE T
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0180801_0180826 HUH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0181171_0181276 LIST OF AGREEMENTS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0182072_0182144 OKAY YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0182498_0182555 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0182709_0182908 UH YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD DAVE'S RIGHT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0182908_0183273 IT COULD BE GOOD IN THE DISPLAY TO ANNOTATE THEM IN THE DISPLAY IF WE CAN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0183273_0183430 YEAH WE COULD JUST MAKE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0183663_0183752 NOT JUST YET
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0183752_0184417 BUT THAT SHOULD THAT'S ACTUALLY THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY I CAN SAY I CAN DO THIS WEEK BECAUSE THAT SHOULD BE I MEAN I'LL DO IT IN AN INEFFICIENT WAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0184417_0184751 I'LL EFFECTIVELY SORT OF GO THROUGH ALL THE SEGMENTS AND CHECK IF THEY'RE CLICKED ON
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0184751_0185637 BUT I THINK DAVE WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS THAT TH UH THE TIME CLICK OF THE CLOCK I THINK THAT'S CHANGEABLE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0185637_0185809 AND I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY INCREASE THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0185809_0186720 BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S ZERO POINT ONE SECONDS AND THAT'S JUST THERE IS ACTUALLY THERE ARE SOME BACKGROUND NOISE WHEN IT'S WORKING AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE DOING SO MUCH EVERY TIME
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0187069_0187446 YEAH IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU D I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE THE VERSION WHERE THE DISPLAY YET
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0187446_0187790 WHERE THE DISPLAY IS ACTUALLY UPDATING UP HERE WHEN IT'S MOVING ON
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0187790_0188031 SO I MEAN YES IT IS BECAUSE MY DISPLAY IS PROGRAMMED INEFFICIENTLY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0188031_0188785 BUT I THINK WITH THE T GIVEN TIME CONSTRAINTS IT'S PROBABLY EASIER INSTEAD OF MAKING A VERY EFFICIENT DISPLAY CODE TO JUST MAKE THE TIME MAKE THE CLOCK WHATEVER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0188785_0189029 ZERO POINT FIVE SECONDS OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0189029_0189118 DO YOU WANT THE MONITOR
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0190101_0190321 IF I CAN SKIP MORE ACCURATELY THEN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0191564_0191650 UH YOU'RE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0194115_0194564 THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S COMING FROM MY RESOLUTION AND IT'S YOU HAVE A MUCH HIGHER RESOLUTION
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0194564_0194605 SO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0213431_0214514 AGAIN I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD PART IF WE HAD A SLIDE B UM BAR INITIALLY WHERE WE COULD DYNAMICALLY ADAPT THE THRESHOLD OF WHAT WE YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0214514_0215262 SO MAYBE IT'S JUST LIKE MAYBE B IT'S JUST GOOD TO HAVE LIKE SOME GENERIC COMPONENT WITH THREE SLIDE BARS OR SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN RELATIVELY EASILY ADD A FOURTH ONE OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0215262_0215585 YOU KNOW AND JUST LIKE SORT OF ALL OUR FIDDLE FACTORS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0215585_0215655 UM BECAUSE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0215846_0216323 UH WELL IT DEPENDS WE WE COULD LIKE IN SOME CASES WE COULD PUT IT AS A FEATURE AND SAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN DYNAMICALLY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0216530_0216605 LIKE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0217073_0217696 WE WOULDN'T CALL IT THRESHOLD WE WOULD SORT OF LIKE THE GRANULARITY OF DECISION OR SOMETHING LIKE IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0217696_0218506 SO AND YEAH AND EVERY AND EVERYTHING ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD I COULD THEN ADD THE UTTERANCE WHERE IT OCCURS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0218506_0219034 JUST PUT A CERTAIN GRAPHICAL ITEM LIKE A HANDSHAKE OR SOMETHING COOL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0219034_0219106 YEAH RIGHT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0220448_0220496 MM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0221088_0221480 YES I WAS J IT I WAS JUST THINKING THE SAME LIKE IT'S IT'S SO TEMPTING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0221480_0222051 LIKE WE WE'LL WE'LL HAVE YELLOW WE'LL HAVE YELLOW SMILIES AND YELLOW ANGRY FACES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0222051_0222319 AH BEAUTIFUL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0222930_0223590 DIDN'T SOMEBODY SAY THAT ACTUALLY LIKE A LOT OF AGREEMENTS HAVE HAVE ACTUAL WORDS WHICH SHOULD SUGGEST DISAGREEMENT LIKE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0224798_0224844 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0225038_0225057 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0229548_0229869 IF THEY'RE CORRESPONDING EA FOR EACH THING YEAH THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0229869_0230267 SO FOR EACH UTTERANCE YOU HAVE ONE AGREEMENT AND ONE DISAGREEMENT SCORE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0230407_0230561 UH SOMETHING LIKE IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0231675_0231775 OKAY YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0231775_0231860 THE ONE WHERE WE CURRENT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0232203_0232385 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0232385_0232492 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0232492_0232590 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0232590_0233287 YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU CAN IF YOU INTRODUCE UM LIKE A SORT OF A STATIC WHAT'S IT CALLED PUBLIC STATIC INT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0233287_0233858 SO BASICALLY A CONSTANT LIKE THAT'S JAVA'S TYPE OF A CONSTANT AND GIVE THEM NAMES LIKE SO ZERO T. D. I. D. F.
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0233858_0234358 ONE THAT PROBABLY MAKES THE CODE A LOT MORE READABLE FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S PLAYING AROUND WITH IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0234358_0234519 YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0234519_0234969 SO JUST LIKE WHATEVER THREE MEANS AGREEMENT VALUE AND THEN I'D JUST WRITE SOMETHING AGREEMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0234969_0235232 AND THEN IT'S EASIER TO UNDERSTAND FOR BOTH OF US WHAT'S GOING ON
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0237108_0237141 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0240250_0240684 I WOULD ALSO TH YEAH BUT I WOULD ALSO TH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0241164_0241201 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0241383_0241412 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0242584_0242926 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD PUT THE THRESHOLD FOR THAT ONE IN THE END QUITE HIGH ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0242926_0243091 SO PROBABLY IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0243091_0243267 BECAUSE I THINK THIS THING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0243573_0243651 NO BUT LIKE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0245429_0245864 BUT I MEAN THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT ONES HAVE THE SAME NUMBER IN ITSELF ISN'T A PROBLEM IS IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0246738_0247176 SO IF IF FOR EVERY YEP YOU'D BE SURE THAT IT'S AN AGREEMENT THAN THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0247176_0247443 SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE NOT SURE IF EVERY YEP IS AN AGREEMENT OR
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0248021_0248067 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0251417_0251936 SO OVER OVER HOW MANY DIFFERENT OVER WHICH LENGTH IS THIS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0251936_0252502 NOW THIS IS LIKE SO THE THIRD COLUMN IS THE UTTERANCE WHERE IT OCCURS RIGHT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0252502_0252957 OKAY SO W I THINK WE REALLY DO HAVE TO PUT THE THRESHOLD QUITE QUITE HIGH THEN BECAUSE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0253167_0253519 YES 'CAUSE IT I WAS JUST I WAS JUST CHECKING YOU KNOW LIKE HOW FAR APART ARE THEY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0253519_0254178 AND AT THE MOMENT THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT A GOOD THING TO DISPLAY IF THEY'RE LIKE AN AVERAGE TEN TEN UTTERANCES APART OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0256477_0256516 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0256715_0256746 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0258667_0258698 AGAIN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0258698_0259698 I'D SAY PROBABLY A GOOD WAY OF GOING ABOUT THAT QUESTION IS TO HAVE A CONTROL WHICH WE CAN VARY IN THE DIS AND THEN JUST SORT OF BECAUSE THAT'S IN THE END HOW IT'S GONNA BE EVALUATED
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0259698_0260251 YOU KNOW IN THE END IT THIS IS GONNA LI I MEAN WE'RE GONNA PRESENT IT AND SAY YEAH SO THIS OUR IT SHOWS DISAGREEMENTS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0260251_0261232 AND THEN WE SEE WHAT WHAT LOOKS GOOD AND WHAT LOOKS I THINK PROBABLY IT LOOKS CREDIBLE IF LIKE AN U IF EVERY SORT OF EVERY TOPIC SEGMENT HAS UM W YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0261232_0261788 OR LIKE OR LIKE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN THE THREE AND AND FIVE AGREEMENTS BUT NOT MORE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0261788_0262342 OR PROBABLY MAYBE LESS BUT NOT MUCH LESS AND ACTUALLY THE I THINK THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ONE IN EVERYTHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0264909_0265434 N YES BUT MAYBE IN AN EXPENSIVE WAY OR MAYBE IN A STUPID LOOKING WAY THOUGH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0265434_0265537 UM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0265938_0266441 YEAH D I'M YEAH I WAS JUST THINKING THAT IT CAN ACT IT CAN PROBABLY BE DONE ON DISPLAY LEVEL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0267280_0267365 THIS ONE CRASHED
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0267365_0267607 MINE JUST CRASHED I THINK WHICH IS BAD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0267607_0268054 IT PROBABLY JUST IT KEPT ON PLAYING AND NOW REACHED SOME WHATEVER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0269920_0270074 MY GOD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0271967_0272069 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0272698_0273590 I THINK SORT OF THE BOTTOM LINE AND WHICH MIGHT WELL END UP WHAT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE IS THAT WE TAKE THE SINGLE HIGHEST RANKED UTTERANCE AND PUT THAT AS A T AS A TITLE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0273590_0274017 LIKE REALISTICALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT TO DO THIS AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0275173_0275200 THERE W
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0275803_0276008 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0276008_0276482 YEAH MAYBE EVEN ON A S ON A SING LIKE I IS THAT ON A R LIKE IS THAT ON A WORD BASIS WOULD THAT BE SINGLE WORDS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0276482_0276566 OR WOULD THAT BE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0276736_0276956 'CAUSE BE CHECK OUT WHAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE ON A WORD BASIS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0276956_0277385 MAYBE ACTUALLY IF IT IF THERE'S ONE WORD WHICH IS VERY TYPICAL I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY SOME WORD LIKE UH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0277385_0277739 BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE THE ONLY TIME THAT UH WAS SPELLED WITH THREE A. AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0277739_0278589 I THINK THAT ACTUALLY THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM OF THE WHOLE UM ANNOTATION THAT IF THEY AREN'T EXACTLY CONSISTENT IN HOW THEY DESCRI UH TRANSCRIBE STUFF LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0278589_0279035 THEN WE PROBABLY CAN'T YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0279035_0279350 'CAUSE THAT'S WHEN WE'RE THINKING SOMETIMES LIKE WHY IS MM HIGH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0279350_0279721 BUT THEN PROBABLY IT'S THE ONLY TIME THAT MM WAS SPELLED WITH A DOT AT THE END AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0279721_0279977 SO BUT YEAH LIKE IF IF SINGLE W
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0281044_0281289 I C I HAVE DICTIONARIES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0281289_0282033 IF IT'S JUST LIKE I HAVE ARBITRARILY LONG LISTS FROM THE BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS OF WHEN T USUALLY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0282313_0282896 WELL LET'S SAY AT LEAST THEY DO IT UH CONSISTENTLY ENOUGH THAT I THINK YOU CAN FILTER THEM OUT FAIRLY WELL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0283925_0284789 YEAH SO IF YOU IF LIKE I MEAN IF THE SINGLE HA BEST ONE WORD FOR A FOR A SEGMENT IS INTERESTING THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0285108_0285214 SEEM TO BE HAVING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0285678_0286047 USE A RANDOM S
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0286791_0287108 'KAY WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS HERE NOW IT SUDDENLY CRASHES AND HANGS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0287671_0288108 YEAH I MEAN THAT WAS THAT WAS SORT OF IN THE ORIGINAL OF THEN THE NICE FANCY DRAWINGS THAT WE GAVE STEVEN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0288108_0289025 I MEAN THAT WAS PART OF IT THAT SORT OF WITHIN THE SEGMENT YOU HAD THESE SUB SEGMENTS AND EACH OF THEM HAD DIFFERENT WORDS AND WHATEVER HAPPENED TO OUR DREAMS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0289025_0289250 ARE THERE ASSIGNMENTS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0289250_0289352 NO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0289728_0289756 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0290952_0291062 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0291062_0291359 POOR MAN'S SOLUTION IS PROBABLY GONNA BE TO HAVE A A LIST
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0291733_0291987 OH SO J YOU YOU ARE THINK OF LOADING THEM ALL AT ONCE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0292267_0292305 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0292497_0292537 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0293056_0293112 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0294061_0294115 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0294372_0294424 EVEN THOUGH WE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0295108_0295139 'KAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0296023_0296090 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0296090_0296747 YEAH I THINK THAT LIKE THE DR THE DRAWING HAS TO BE CHANGED ANYWAY THE IT'S NOT IDEAL AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0296747_0297333 UM YEAH SO IF PERFORMANCE WISE IT GENERALLY WORKS FINE FOR THE DISPLAY IT SHOULDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0297333_0297936 'CAUSE I THINK EVERYTHING IN THE DISPLAY CODE IS JUST FROM THE FIRST UNTIL THE LAST ONE DISPLAYED
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0297936_0298401 SO IF IF THE OTHER PERFORMANCE IS OKAY THEN WE SHOULD REALLY JUST LOAD THE WHOLE THING IN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0298575_0298641 I'M VERY DIS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0301318_0301891 SEE THAT PROBABLY JUST MEANS THAT THE DISPLAY SORT OF HAS AN INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT LEVEL OF ZOOM IT HAS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0301891_0302027 SO INITIALLY THE DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0303063_0303152 YES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0303378_0303416 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0303598_0303715 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0303715_0304443 THAT'S PROBABLY FAIRLY SIMPLE TO DO ACTUALLY IF WE DO IT IN THAT MOST PRIMITIVE WAY OF JUST SAYING AS LONG AS YOU DISPLAY MORE THAN ONE MEETING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0305172_0305310 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0305310_0305589 WE THEN NEED SOME WAY OF GETTING BACK UP AGAIN IN THE HIERARCHY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0305589_0306273 BUT THAT IN THE WORST CASE IT WILL JUST BE A STATIC SORT OF ARROW UP BUTTON IN THE RIGHT HAND TOPPER CORNER OF THE DISPLAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0306273_0306565 AND YOU PRESS THAT AND THEN YOU'RE ON THE DISPLAY THE WHOLE THING AGAIN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0306565_0307494 BUT FOR THAT AT THE MOMENT MY DISPLAY CODE NEEDS THAT THING TO WORK THE ONE OH NO THAT'S WORKING AT THE MOMENT ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0307494_0308132 THE ONE THAT I JUST SAY GIVE ME ONE HUNDRED VALUES OVER THAT LENGTH AND THEN YOU'RE INTERNALLY OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0308132_0308740 BUT YEAH BUT UH THAT'S OKAY AS LONG AS MY DISPLAY I WAS JUST THINKING MY DISPLAY CAN'T HANDLE DISPLAYING A MILLION DIFFERENT SEGMENTS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0308740_0308976 BUT NOW R NO BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0308976_0309155 EVEN NOW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0309155_0309288 OKAY WELL THAT'S ALL DETAILS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0309288_0309943 UM SO DAVE CAN YOU JUST TURN THIS WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0311053_0311212 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0311212_0311242 MAKE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0311837_0311940 UH AND IF AN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0312702_0313069 IF ANYONE FEELS THAT THEY HAVE FREE TIME UH THIS IS A JOKE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0313069_0314230 UM ONE THING THAT WOULD BE CONVENIENT FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND WHICH I HAVEN'T FOUND OUT ABOUT IT IS HOW TO DO TOOL TIPS IN AN ARBITRARY WAY IN IN IN SWING GRAPHIC DISPLAYS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0314230_0314761 NOW THERE IS SIMPLE WAYS OF DOING TOOL TIPS OVER A GIVEN ELEMENT LIKE IF YOU HAVE A BUTTON AND YOU JUST GIVE IT A TOOL TIP TEXT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0314761_0315203 BUT THERE IS MEANS OF DOING TOOL TIPS THAT JUST I C I PUT MY MOUSE OVER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0315203_0315565 LET'S SAY I PUT MY MOUSE OVER THIS LINE HERE AND THEN IT WOULD TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IT IS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0315565_0316315 AND THAT WOULD BE QUITE CONVENIENT FOR A LOT OF THINGS BECAUSE THEN WE CAN SORT OF HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THE DISPLAY IN THE IN THE WAY THAT JUST WHEN THE MOUSE IS OVER IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0316315_0317056 BUT I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW IT WORKS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY SO IF EVERYONE IS EVER BORED OR ANYONE FEELS THAT THEY CAN DO THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0318193_0318303 YES BUT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0318660_0319265 YEAH BUT THE THE THING IS IT IT ISN'T SIMPLY AN ACT OF SETTING A STRING DEFAULT TOOL TIP
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0319265_0319848 THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT A TOOL TIP OBJECT THAT YOU HAVE TO CREATE AND GIVE IT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND STUFF OR
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0320229_0320260 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0320260_0320402 SO ANYWAY I HAVEN'T LOOKED MUCH INTO THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0320402_0320751 SO IF IF ANYBODY LOOKS INTO THAT THEN LET ME KNOW
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0320751_0320964 OTHERWISE I'LL START LOOKING INTO IT AS SOON AS I HAVE TIME AGAIN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0320964_0321048 BUT IF ANYBODY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0321521_0321641 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0321641_0322055 I FOUND SOME STUFF ABOUT IT ON THE WEB AND IT JUST LOOKED TO ME LIKE PROPER CODING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0322055_0322809 LIKE I SAW HALF PAGE CODE SAMPLES WHICH EFFECTIVELY JUST DISPLAYED A TOOL TIP AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME AT THAT POINT TO GET DEEPER INTO THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0322809_0323332 SO IF ANYBODY GETS ANY GOOD SAMPLES OF THAT NEVER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0323332_0323532 ANYWAYS THAT IS THAT IT FOR NOW
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0324068_0324463 NO BUT I'M GONNA I'M GOING UP APPLETON TOWER NOW AND I HAVE MY EXTERNAL HARD DISK
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0324463_0324529 SO I CAN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0325005_0325038 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0325417_0325691 IS THERE ANY DICE MACHINES IN THIS BUILDING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0325691_0325795 FREELY ACCESSIBLE FOR ME
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0325795_0326111 CAN YOU SHOW ME WHERE BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO APPLETON TOWER AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0326111_0326376 SO THEN I DON'T HAVE TO GO UP AND DOWN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0326376_0326881 ACTUALLY NO BUT I HAVE TO GO THERE ANYWAY AND PUT A PIECE OF PAPER ON TWO MACHINES WHERE SOME STUFF OF MINE IS RUNNING ON
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0327564_0328412 YEAH AND I THINK LIKE I'LL JUST I'LL JUST KICK IN FULL TIME FOR N. L. S. S. D. NEXT WEEK 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING I HAVE TO DO THEN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0328412_0328962 APART FROM COGNITIVE MODELLING WHICH I THINK I'LL JUST DO IN FIVE HOURS THREE HOURS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0328962_0329052 YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0329363_0329499 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0329499_0330305 I MIGHT JUST NOT GO FOR THE LAST QUESTION BECAUSE USUALLY THE LAST QUESTION IS TAKES HALF THE TIME AND GIVES YOU FIVE PERCENT OR SOMETHING LIKE OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0332463_0332493 REALLY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0332704_0332749 OKAY

AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0334111_0334223 I MEAN WE DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0334223_0334247 SO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0334478_0334795 IT'S SORT OF COMING AS A SHOCK TO ME NOW BECAUSE I WAS SORT OF IN THIS MINDSET
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0334795_0335134 LIKE I FIRST KNEW OH THERE'S A LOT OF TIME BETWEEN THE PRESENTATION AND THE REPORT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0335134_0335396 AND THEN I KNEW OH NOW THE PRESENTATION IS SHIFTED
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0335396_0336210 BUT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO FACTS THE INTERDEPENDENCIES THERE'S SOME FANCY PLANNING LANGUAGE ABOUT THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0336210_0336268 BUT THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0336442_0336859 YES IT'S UM IT'S PROBABLY SOME VERSION OF THE FRAME PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0336859_0337048 FRAME PLOB PROBLEM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0337048_0337166 HASN'T BEEN CLEAR TO ME
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0339527_0339629 WELL I RECKON THAT IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0339818_0339928 I RECKON THAT PROBAB
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0340867_0341452 BUT IF YOU JUST PRESENT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE THING IF YOU'RE NOT LIKE I DON'T THINK THIS PRESENTATION IS ABOUT THE INTERNAL WORKING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0341452_0341643 SO YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0341643_0342103 SO FOR A DEMO I THINK REALISTICALLY SINCE EVERYTHING IN THIS UNIVERSITY SORT OF WORKS IN ONE HOUR SLOTS AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0342103_0342498 SO IF IT'S TWO GROUPS THEN IT PROBABLY IT'S GONNA BE ROUGHLY HALF AN HOUR ISH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0342906_0342928 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0343157_0343579 NO WHY IS TH THIS IS GONNA BE SO BAD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0343579_0343764 LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE SOME SMALL L
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0344202_0344538 YEAH BUT THE PERFORMANCE IS REALLY BAD AT THE MOMENT ON THAT ONE THOUGH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0344706_0345012 PLUS WE WOULD HAVE TO GET THE SPEECH TOOLS RUNNING ON MY LAPTOP THEN WOULDN'T WE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0345312_0345348 MM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0345529_0345666 WELL LET'S LET'S SEE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0345666_0346027 DID IT IT COULD JUST BE FLUENT ON THE LAPTOP FOR ALL I KNOW
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0346027_0346550 I MEAN LIKE AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT TOO BAD APART FROM I THINK THE SOUND IS STUTTERING AND THAT'S B I THINK BECAUSE OF THE LAPTOP
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0346550_0346914 BUT WE CAN ONLY REALLY JUDGE THAT ONCE WE HAVE SOUND FILES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0347770_0347885 HOW FAST IS YOURS VERA
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0348081_0348114 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0348296_0348663 WELL NET WOULD RUN ON ANYTHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0348663_0348752 BUT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0348914_0348976 YES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0349204_0349278 NO THAT'S TRUE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0349278_0349464 YEAH THAT'S TRUE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0349464_0349629 VIRTUAL MACHINE SHOULD BE FINE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0349629_0350140 BUT BUT BUT THAT ALL RELIES ON FINDING SOME WAY OF GETTING THE SPEECH TOOLS TO DO THEIR JOB
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0350343_0351359 YEAH SEE THAT'S 'CAUSE THAT'S THE THING LIKE THAT WOULD RELY ON I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO RUN THE SPEECH TOOLS IN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0352050_0352518 NO NO NO NO D WHEREVER THIS IS GOING IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0352518_0352579 UM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0352954_0353452 WE CAN HE CAN USE MY LAPTOP AS SORT OF LIKE AS A AS A SERVER AS A SOUND SERVER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0353452_0353856 BUT THAT WOULD STILL MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO GET THE SPEECH TOOLS RUNNING ON THIS
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0353856_0354206 NO YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN THE WAY JAVA WORKS IS THAT T
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0354410_0355051 I THINK IT'LL RUN ON ON THEIR DICE MACHINE IF WE'RE DOING IT IN IF WE WELL WE SHOULD DEFINITELY TEST IT THE DAY BEFORE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0355225_0355390 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0355390_0355423 'KAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0356292_0356663 SO DAVE ARE YOU GONNA MAKE SOMETHING PRIMITIVE THAT PEOPLE CAN LOAD THEIR DATA IN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0356876_0356901 OK
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0357659_0357703 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0357966_0357996 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0357996_0358872 I'M NOT I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO MAKE IT WORK WITH THE TO MAKE IT NOT CRASH IF IT DOESN'T HAVE A SOUND CARD
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0358872_0359282 THERE'S THERE'S QUITE A BIT YOU HAVE TO COMMENT OUT FOR THAT WHICH IS STUPID BECAUSE I
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0359798_0359848 YEAH THE YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0359848_0360650 NO BUT THE THING IS THE DISPLAY CALLS METHODS WHICH PROBABLY EXPECT SOME SO I THINK IF THE DISPLAY ITSELF ISN'T DOING ANYTHING CLOCKY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0360650_0361230 SO AS LONG AS IN THE MAIN PR IN THE PROGRAMME MANAGER EVERYTHING CLOCKY IS IS REMOVED
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0361230_0361771 BUT UH I W IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TO CHECK HOW MUCH WORK IT WOULD BE TO DO IT OVER A FLAG
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0361771_0362167 'CAUSE THEN IN THE END I 'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE ALWAYS HAVE TWO CODE VERSIONS AND PEOPLE MIGHT BE CHANGING THE WRONG ONE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0362765_0362863 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0362863_0363021 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0363021_0363105 YEAH THAT'S TRUE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0363105_0363408 I JUST I KNOW THAT LIKE IF YOU DON'T DO IT WITH THE EXCEPTIONS CRASHES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0363408_0363495 THAT'S WHAT FIGURED OUT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0363495_0363867 LIKE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUND CARD IT CRASHES EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE SOUND
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0363867_0363955 YEAH OKAY COOL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0366450_0366771 UH I THINK THE DISPLAY HAS SOME METHOD FOR IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0366771_0367040 I'M NOT ACTUALLY LIKE FOR THE PROGRAMME MANAGER THEN TO CALL
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0367040_0367498 I'M NOT ACTUALLY A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT THE DISPLAY HAS SOME METHOD WHERE YOU TELL IT WHERE TO START AND WHERE TO END
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0367957_0368125 YEAH OR THERE'S GONNA BE SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0371445_0371683 WELL ACTUALLY DAVE DA DAVE DAVE DAVE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0372039_0372080 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0372080_0372529 NO SORRY I'VE UH I WAS WRONG I WAS THINKING IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE SAY SET SELECT NO IT DOES NOT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0372529_0372837 BUT ACTUALLY A SET SELECTION DOES EVERYTHING YOU WANT SORT OF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0373171_0373390 NO BUT SET SELECTION DOESN'T UPDATE THE DISPLAY THOUGH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0373390_0374225 BECAUSE WELL IT IT DOESN'T TELL THE DISPLAY WHICH PART TO DI WHICH PART TO TO DISPLAY BECAUSE THE DISPLAY HAS JUST CALLED SET SELECTION TO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0374866_0374902 IF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0375358_0375974 YEAH BUT THAT ONLY WORKS THAT AT THE MOMENT ISN'T DONE THROUGH OUR SYSTEM THAT'S JUST DONE BECAUSE THEN THE TIME CHANGES
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0375974_0376526 SO ACTUALLY A TIME CHANGE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY PUT THE POSITION OF THE DISPLAY IN THE RIGHT PLAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0376526_0376994 UH NO BUT THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THAT COULD WELL BE OUTSIDE THE DISPLAYED AREA THEN
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0377502_0377580 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0377580_0377661 SO
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0377992_0378023 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0378023_0378462 NO I THINK THE DISPLAY HAS A METHOD FOR THAT READY WHICH IS CALLED
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0378713_0378978 ANYWAY THE DISPLAY HAS SOMETHING USEFUL FOR THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0378978_0379170 SOMETHING WHICH PROBABLY STARTS WITH THE WORD SET
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0379663_0380030 YEAH YOU CAN SET THE WINDOW START UTTERANCE AND WINDOW END UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0382351_0382384 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0382643_0383046 ALTERNATIVELY THERE'S ALWAYS THE METHOD OF JUST GIVING IT A REALLY HIGH SCORE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0383046_0383614 AS A HACK YOU KNOW LIKE JUST AS LONG AS YOU THEN DON'T WELL PROBABLY PEOPLE WOULDN'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0384078_0384115 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0384298_0384835 WELL YOU COULD YOU COULD PUT ONE POINT ONE WHEN THE OTHER ONES ONLY GO UP TO THE ONE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0384835_0385113 BUT NO IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A NICE WAY I'M JUST SAYING
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0386338_0386918 YEAH PROBABLY THAT ACTUALLY TRUE THAT IF YOU'RE DOING A SEARCH YOU'RE USUALLY NOT INTERESTED IN A CONDENSED WAY BUT IN THE IN THE FULL THING ANYWAY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0388973_0389019 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0389157_0389206 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0389562_0390409 I THINK PROPORTION LIKE I EVEN THOUGH I'M I'M ALWAYS GETTING MYSELF CONFUSED ABOUT THIS BUT I THINK SORT OF MAKING THE SUMMARY LENGTH THING GENERALLY PROPORTION
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0390409_0390885 LIKE AS A AS A PROPORTIONAL FACTOR OF OF ITS ORIGINAL LENGTH IS A GOOD WAY OF GOING ABOUT IT
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0390885_0391746 BECAUSE ANYTHING WITH ABSOLUTE LENGTH'S SORT OF STUPID BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT A LONG LONG SEGMENT GETS TO ONE PERCENT OF ITS LENGTH AND ANOTHER ONE GETS TO EXACTLY THE SAME LENGTH AND STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0391746_0392921 SO IF WE'RE DOING IT BY A PROPORTION THEN JUST HAVING ONE POINT ZERO OR SOMETHING MAKES IT VERY EASY TO ALWAYS END UP AT THE ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT I'VE CURRENTLY LIKE THE CURRENT CODE JUST TAKES A TENTH OF THE SUMMARY LENGTH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0392921_0393205 SO YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0393205_0393707 AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF SLIDER THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LEAVE IN AND LIKE SHOW 'CAUSE THAT'S THAT'S FUNCTIONALITY
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0393707_0394096 YEAH THAT'S SORT OF LIKE YOUR LEVEL OF THE ZOOM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0394096_0394376 OF IMPENDING DOOM
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0394376_0394551 SHALL WE QUIT HERE
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0394551_0394712 ANYTHING TO BE DISCUSSED
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0395132_0395469 'CAUSE I'M GONNA COPY THAT STUFF OVER
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0395975_0396188 YEAH OTHERWISE YOU'LL YOU'LL DEFINITELY SEE ME IN M. S. N.
AMI_EN2001e_H01_MEO069_0396188_0396358 SO I'LL JUST
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0052811_0053465 IT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM FOR ME AT THE STAGE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I BASED EVERYTHING ON NOT HAVING THOSE UM
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0053729_0053780 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0053976_0054177 UH WHAT I ALSO
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0054309_0054912 YEAH WHAT I ALSO DID WAS HAVING TWO PEOPLE UM ANNOTATE THE FIRST MEETING
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0054912_0055475 AND SO THEY DIDN'T ANNOTATE THE N N UH UH THE SPACES AND EVERYTHING WOULD MESS UP
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0055475_0056514 I THINK IF I HAD SPACES FOR THE UM NEW VALUES SO WHEN I WENT TO DO CORRELATION IT WOULDN'T WORK ANYMORE
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0056514_0056579 SO I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0057127_0058366 OH WHAT I COULD DO IS UM WORK UM FURTHER WITH UM WHAT I'VE GOT NOW AND THEN JUST WHEN I HAVE MY UM UM YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0058366_0058911 THE FINAL FORMULA READY I COULD UH T APPLY TO THE NEW STUFF
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0058911_0058984 THAT WOULD BE OKAY

AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0061567_0061614 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0062775_0063091 IS IT STILL THE OLD OLD T. F. I. D. F.
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0063091_0063145 OH OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0097141_0097159 HMM
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0102783_0102808 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0103044_0103163 I THINK SO TOO
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0110802_0111334 HOW ABOUT THE SUMMARISATION AGAIN YOU WANTED TO BASE IT ON SENTENCE LENGTH AS WELL
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0111334_0111798 AND I'VE GOT A SENTENCE LENGTH INCORPORATED INTO MY IMPORTANCE MEASURE AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0111798_0111861 SO
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0112307_0112415 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0112415_0112791 BUT IF WE DO IT TWICE IT WOULDN'T MAKE TOO MUCH SENSE
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0112791_0113212 DON'T KNOW HOW EXACTLY WE WILL WANT TO IMPLEMENT YOUR
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0170995_0171044 WE CAN
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0192704_0193360 ARE WE STILL WITH THAT IDEA THAT WE WANT TO DISPLAY BARS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SPEAKERS
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0193360_0193431 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0193431_0193736 AND ALSO DISPLAYING THE SPEAKERS BEFORE AN UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0193784_0193809 OKAY
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0271568_0272036 SO TOBY YOU WANTED TO UH HAVE KEYWORDS FOR EACH TOPIC SEGMENT OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0272036_0272436 UM WHO WOULD UH WHO UH PROVIDES THE VALUES FOR THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0272579_0272623 NO ONE

AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0274141_0274715 BECAUSE WHAT I DO IS UM HAVING UM VALUES FOR EACH SEGMENT AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0274715_0275171 SO I COULD JUST EXTRACT THE HIGHEST ONES FOR EACH SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0275171_0275423 I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOOD OR BAD
AMI_EN2001e_H02_FEO065_0275423_0275694 IT COULD BE AT LEAST I COULD PROVIDE SOME VALUE

AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0017488_0018235 IT DEPENDS WHICH DATA YOU USE AS WELL BECAUSE UM IF YOU USE THE DATA WHERE THEY'RE ALL REALLY HIGH
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0018235_0018652 IT DOES PREFER ONES FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE IT JUST PICKS THE FIRST ONES IT FINDS
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0018938_0019059 BUT I'LL CHECK IT OUT ANYWAY

AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0268341_0268793 I THINK IT'S ALWAYS REALLY FUNNY THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS WHO DON'T USE THE COMPUTER MUCH
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0268793_0269254 THEIR DESKTOP'S REALLY TIDY AND WHEN YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO USE IT ALL THE TIME THERE'S STUFF EVERYWHERE
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0269254_0269552 SO MINE'S LIKE THAT AS WELL
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0269694_0269733 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0272548_0272583 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0273436_0273476 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0279941_0281058 MAYBE WE SHOULD UM DOWNLOAD A DICTIONARY AND CHECK OUR UTTERANCES BEFORE WE UH LISTEN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY REAL WORDS
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0281058_0281137 DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0283239_0283423 YEAH I MEAN SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0283423_0283768 IF THEY LOOK GOOD THEN THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT AS ANY I SUPPOSE
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0285187_0285978 ACTUALLY WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IS TAKE THE HIGHEST THREE OR FOUR AND THEN JUST MERGE THEM TOGETHER INTO ONE UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0285978_0286622 IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT IT'D GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0287196_0287237 YEAH
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0288950_0289162 YEAH I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TIME FOR THAT
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0289431_0289649 WHICH IS A SHAME 'CAUSE IT WOULD'VE BEEN COOL
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0290530_0290907 UM AT THE MOMENT IT DOESN'T REALLY CARE HOW MANY MEETINGS IT'S DISPLAYING
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0291287_0291645 JUST DRAW A BIG BLACK LINE ON THE BORDERS I THINK
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0292007_0292315 WELL Y YOU YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0292315_0292345 IT'S
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0292505_0292898 'CAUSE IT JU IT CAN DISPLAY FROM ANY UTTERANCE TO ANY OTHER UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0292898_0292974 IT DOESN'T REALLY
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0293587_0293727 DO THEY

AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0298612_0299402 ONE THING WE WILL HAVE TO DO IS WE WANT WE'D REALLY WANT A DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR IF WE CLICKED ON A WHOLE MEETING THAN A SEGMENT
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0299402_0299816 SO IF THERE'S MORE THAN ONE MEETING DISPLAYED
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0299816_0300545 IT SHOULD UM IF YOU CLICK EVEN ON ONE THE SEGMENTS OF THAT MEETING I THINK IT SHOULD RE INITIALIZE AND DISPLAY THAT JUST THAT MEETING
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0300760_0300989 SO I'M NOT SU I'M NOT SURE HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE TO DO
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0302091_0302504 IT JUST NEEDS TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S DISPLAYING MORE THAN ONE WHOLE MEETING DOESN'T IT
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0302504_0302573 THAT'S THE ONLY
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0302799_0302899 KNOWLEDGE IT WOULD NEED
AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0303397_0303745 BUT ANYWAY WE CAN SORT THAT OUT IF WE HAVE TIME ONCE WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING ELSE

AMI_EN2001e_H03_MEE067_0311902_0312301 BUT MY CODE I'VE NOT DOCUMENTED THE PROGRAMME MANAGER CLASS

AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0031229_0031775 THAT THEY DON'T GO OH WE'RE JUST GETTING RUBBISH FROM Y YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0032068_0032867 UM AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT CLAIRE SENDING IT IS SHE'S PROBABLY GOT A PSYCH EMAIL ADDRESS AS WELL AND IT IT MIGHT LOOK A BIT MORE RELEVANT TO THEM
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0033025_0033182 YEAH EXACTLY

AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0034404_0035006 UM THE BASIS FOR HER EMAIL BUT JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW IT'S RELEVANT TO THEM ET CETERA

AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0036013_0036590 IN A WAY WE COULD SEND OUT THAT FIRST CALL TO THEM JUST AS PART OF THE SAME EMAIL
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0036590_0037077 BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO THINK IT WAS RELEVANT TO THEM
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0037077_0037149 I DON'T REALLY KNOW
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0037149_0037328 I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0037328_0037757 BUT UM I THINK WE DEFINITELY SHOULD OPEN IT UP TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0037757_0038598 UM I THINK PARTICULARLY AT THE MOMENT 'CAUSE THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO SORT OF UH MERGE US INTO ONE SUBJECT AREA
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0038598_0039041 EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD BE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE WE'RE ALL PART OF A SCHOOL I THINK THAT IT DOES ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0039041_0039849 AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD INVITE THEM BUT THEN WE'VE STILL GOT THE PROBLEM OF UH A PRIORITY ISSUE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0039849_0041136 SO YOU KNOW PROBABLY WHAT I WAS THINKING IS UM CERTAINLY SECOND AND THIRD YEARS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE UH TOP ON TOP PRIORITY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0041136_0041539 BUT THEN THERE'S A KIND OF AWKWARD QUESTION OF WHERE WE PUT FIRST YEARS BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0041539_0041772 IF THEY WANT TO SHOULD THEY HAVE PRIORITY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0041940_0042529 THIS IS A KIND OF LOWER POINT BUT UH IT KIND OF IT CROSSES OVER WITH DECIDING

AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0147749_0148179 AS OPPOSED TO WHEN I'LL NEED AN HOUR OVER THREE DA YOU KNOW AN HOUR EACH DAY FOR THREE DAYS
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0148179_0148623 IT YOU CAN END UP HAVING TO TAKE THREE AFTERNOONS OR THREE MORNINGS OR WHATEVER OFF
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0148623_0148990 SO I THINK IN GENERAL AND ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF THE LECTURERS
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0149047_0149859 UH I THINK A LOT OF THE TIME SIMON KIRBY HAS ALREADY SAID TO ME THAT ANYONE ANY OF HIS STUDENTS HE WANTS TO BE ON THE FIRST DAY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0149859_0149977 ON THE WEDNESDAY RIGHT
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0149977_0150381 AND THAT'S BECAUSE I SHIFTED IT I BASICALLY HAD IT ON MONDAY TUESDAY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0150381_0150943 WEDNESDAY TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN EVE IT MOVED DOWN TWICE TO WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0150943_0151197 SO WEDNESDAY IS THE ONLY DAY LEFT THAT HE CAN MAKE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0151311_0151375 SO
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0151532_0151560 YEAH
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0151560_0151978 SO AND THE OTHER THING IS UM WHEN WE GET SOME CALLS SAY WE HAVE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0152133_0152574 UH FOR INSTANCE THREE PEOPLE SUPERVISED BY BOB LADD
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0152574_0153375 THEN IT MIGHT BE THAT THEN WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO UH CONTACT BOB AND SAY BOB THESE THREE OF YOUR STUDENTS ARE GONNA BE TALKING
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0153375_0153606 UM PRESU PRESUMABLY YOU WANT TO BE THERE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0153606_0153958 SO CAN YOU GIVE US A TIME THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0153958_0154135 AND THEN WE CAN PUT THEM IN A BLOCK AT ONE TIME
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0154135_0154524 'CAUSE HE SAYS YEAH OKAY THURSDAY AFTERNOON I'VE GOT COMPLETELY FREE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0154524_0155046 SO I THINK WE DO NEED TO STICK EVERYONE TOGETHER UH PARTICULARLY IF THEY'VE GOT THE SAME SUPERVISOR
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0155046_0155605 AND IT'S ALSO GOOD IF TALKS ARE ON THE SAME TOPIC FOR A WHOLE MORNING OR A WHOLE AFTERNOON BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE WILL COME ALONG AND GO OH
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0155605_0155949 THIS MORNING IT'S ALL ON PHONOLOGY OR THIS MORNING IT'S ALL ON APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0155949_0156006 AND THEN
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0156152_0156214 OKAY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0156488_0156640 AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ANYWAY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0157914_0158052 YEAH
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0158052_0158625 NOW WE NEED IF I'M GONNA SEND OUT THIS CALL UH WE NEED A DEADLINE FOR TITLES
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0158625_0158676 SO
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0158789_0158877 UM
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0159089_0159153 WHAT SHOULD WE SAY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0159153_0159532 SOMETHING LIKE 'CAUSE WE NEED A DEADLINE FOR TITLES AND A DEADLINE FOR ABSTRACTS
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0159532_0159816 SO LET'S SET THE THE LATEST DEADLINE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0159816_0160678 THE THE UH THE THE SORT OF ABSTRACTS DEADLINE FIRST BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE A MEETING AND THAT'S GONNA BE WHEN ALL THE REAL WORK STARTS
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0160872_0161089 SO WHAT'S THE ABSOLUTE LATEST
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0161089_0161300 I WAS THINK I MEAN MAYBE THE END OF
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0162026_0162178 END OF MARCH MIGHT BE OKAY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0162178_0162948 UH I'M GOING AWAY FOR TWO WEEKS ON THE FOURTH OF APRIL
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0162948_0163218 AND THEN I'M COMING BACK JUST IN TIME FOR THE CONFERENCE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0163218_0163841 SO ANY ORGANISING AT LEAST STUFF WHERE I NEED TO BE WHERE WE NEED TO MEET PHYSICALLY HAS TO BE DONE BEFORE THAT
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0165140_0165332 I TELL YOU ONE THING
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0165332_0165698 UH IT'S STARTING ON THE WEDNESDAY AND THE FIRST DAY BACK IS TUESDAY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0165698_0165875 I THINK I'M COMING BACK
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0166232_0166428 I'M TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0166428_0166880 HOPEFULLY I'LL BE BACK IN TIME THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING THE DAY BEFORE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0166880_0167026 'CAUSE I THINK I'M GONNA BE BACK
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0167162_0167341 MIGHT EVEN HAVE TO COME IN IN THE EVENING
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0167341_0167678 BUT THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SET SOME THINGS UP
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0167678_0167958 LIKE MAYBE JUST GET THE CHAIRS ORGANISED OR WHATEVER
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0167958_0168374 WE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO INTO THE ROOMS AND GET THINGS READY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0168374_0168888 AND THERE'S GONNA BE OTHER THINGS LIKE GETTING THE TECHNOLOGY READY
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0168888_0169406 SO NOT ONLY IS THERE A PRESSURE TO HAVE UH
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0169524_0170104 TALKS THAT ARE ON A SIMILAR TOPIC TOGETHER BUT ALSO IF PEOPLE NEED THE SAME KIND OF COMPUTER SET UP
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0170104_0170380 IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THEM TOGETHER SO WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP CHANGING IT
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0170380_0171018 SO BECAUSE I TH I THINK IT WAS CEDRIC HAS ALREADY OFFERED TO DO WHATEVER WE NEED HIM TO DO
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0171018_0171515 BUT HE JUST NEEDS TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT PEOPLE NEED SO THAT HE CAN BE THERE AND AND GET IT READY FOR THEM
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0171659_0171986 SO I THINK WHEN PEOPLE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0172184_0173111 WELL HOPEFULLY MOST PEOPLE WILL D EITHER HAVE SOMETHING LIKE POWERPOINT OR THEY'LL JUST HAVE UH P. D. F. SLIDES OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0173111_0173450 HOPEFULLY NO ONE WILL HAVE ANYTHING TOO SPECIALIZED
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0173450_0173553 S SH Z
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0174186_0174238 YEAH
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0175721_0175833 YEAH IT'S GOT A LOT IN THERE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0175833_0176674 BUT I THINK IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF I MEAN UH I THINK SOMETIMES MAYBE PEOPLE NEED TO BE IN LINUX RATHER THAN WINDOWS AND SO BOOTING IN AND OUT
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0176862_0177084 M IS SOMETIMES AN ISSUE I THINK
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0177084_0177160 UM
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0177440_0177818 BUT I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD SAY IS WHEN I PUT OUT THIS CALL
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0177818_0178184 I'LL PUT BOTH DEADLINES AND I THINK I'LL SAY THAT WHEN YOU SEND IN YOUR ABSTRACT

AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0182547_0182942 AND THEN GIVE THEM A WEEK ON TOP OF THAT TO GET THE ACTUAL ABSTRACT DONE
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0182942_0183366 AND THE ABSTRACT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MUCH IT'S PROBABLY ONLY HALF A SIDE OF A. FOUR OR SOMETHING ISN'T IT
AMI_EN2003a_H00_MEE075_0183366_0183852 JUST ENOUGH THAT WE CAN SEE WHETHER IT'S INTERESTING OR WHAT KIND OF AREA IT FITS INTO

AMI_EN2003a_H03_MEO074_0084725_0085075 ACTUALLY WE HAVE A MESSAGE HERE FROM MITS ABOUT THE POSTER SESSION
AMI_EN2003a_H03_MEO074_0085075_0085502 POSTER SESSION WAS INTRODUCED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AS PART OF THE MAIN CONFERENCE
AMI_EN2003a_H03_MEO074_0085502_0085776 IN TWO THOUSAND IT WAS HELD SEPARATELY IN OCTOBER
AMI_EN2003a_H03_MEO074_0085776_0086352 THE INTENTION WAS TO USE IT AS A WAY TO INTRODUCE INCOMING POST GRAD STUDENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT'S RESEARCH CULTURE
AMI_EN2003a_H03_MEO074_0086352_0087020 HOWEVER I DID NOT PURSUE THIS IDEA THE FOLLOWING YEAR BECAUSE THE COMMENTS I RECEIVED FROM STUDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND WERE GENERALLY DISCOURAGING
AMI_EN2003a_H03_MEO074_0087136_0087753 ON THE OTHER HAND I LATER LEARNED THAT SOME STUDENTS DID FIND THE OCTOBER POSTER SESSION QUITE A USEFUL EXPERIENCE
AMI_EN2003a_H03_MEO074_0087753_0088487 MY SUGGESTION THEREFORE IS TO RE EXAMINE THE IDEA OF POSTER SESSION ALTOGETHER AND FIND A BETTER WAY TO IMPLEMENT IT IF THERE SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH INTEREST IN IT

AMI_EN2004a_H01_FEE078_0300196_0300726 BUT HOPEFULLY THE THAT'LL BE DONE DURING THE FIRST PASS BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
AMI_EN2004a_H01_FEE078_0300726_0300964 MAKING THE CHECKERS' JOB A LITTLE EASIER
AMI_EN2004a_H01_FEE078_0300964_0301975 UM AND THEN YEAH JUST M UM BE SURE AFTER YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE FOUR CHANNELS TO UM DO A SEARCH ON ALL THE UNKNOWNS

AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0020466_0021568 SO UH AND CURRENTLY I'M MORE INTERESTED IN SEE UH UH YEAH ANALYSING THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0021568_0021863 THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO PRESENT HERE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0021863_0021996 SO UH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0022208_0023346 UH IN THIS PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO SEE HOW WE COULD ANALYSE UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE RELATIONS IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0023346_0023404 UM
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0023598_0024287 'CAUSE MEETINGS IS A LIT DIFFERENT FROM NORMAL TEXT OR A N A NORMAL DIALOGUE OR MONOLOGUE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0024287_0025861 SO INTERACTIVITY IS A CONCEPT IS A CONCEPT THAT I'M USING TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO UH UH EXTREMES OF UH OF INTERAC UH OF DISCOURSE IN MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0025861_0027144 AND UH FOR DIALOGUES UH AND MONOLOGUES I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO USE DIFFERENT UH CONCEPTS TO M M UH MODEL THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0027144_0028335 THEN UH I W I WILL UH GIVE A VERY UH ROUGH PLAN FOR THE NEXT UH COUPLE OF MONTH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0028335_0028794 AND FINALLY I I WILL INTR I INTRODUCE SOME RELATED WORK YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0028794_0028844 SO
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0029036_0029905 THE BIG QUESTION THAT I'M CONCERN HERE IS WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UTTERANCES IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0029905_0030848 OR HOW DO WE ANALYSE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE RIGHT ABOVE UTTERANCES INSTEAD OF UH THOSE HIGH LEVEL INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE OF DISCOURSE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0030848_0031758 SO THE CONCERN HERE IS ABOUT THE VERY LOCAL LOW LEVEL UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE RELATIONS IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0031758_0032118 UH THIS IS THE LOCAL DISCOURSE STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0032150_0033395 SO THE UH BUILDING BLOCK OF THAT KIND OF UH STRUCTURE WOULD BE THE UH UTTERANCE AND POSSIBLY ONE OF ITS PROPERTIES
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0033395_0034243 THE DIALOGUE ACT WHICH WE'RE CURRENTLY UH WORKING ON OR UH AND UH FOR MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0034243_0035529 YEAH SO I'VE MENTIONED UH UH BEFORE THAT MEETINGS IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM UH MONOLOGUE AND UH DIALOGUES
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0035764_0036965 SO UH IN MEETINGS I UH FROM MY UH READING OF THE ONE OF THE AMI MEETINGS I. S. ONE O. EIGHT UH THE UH THE FOUR MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0036965_0038221 I NOTICED THAT UH UH THE INTERACTION DEGREES OF INTERACTION IN THE MEETINGS UH VARIES FROM PARTS TO PARTS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0038221_0038740 SO FOR SOME PART UH THE INTERACTION IS VERY STRONG
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0038740_0039064 SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A DIALOGUE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0039064_0040119 BUT UH FOR SOME PART PART WHERE THE INTERACTION IS VERY WEAK UH JUST UH LIKE THE UH CHAIRMAN OR PROJECT MANAGER IS MM
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0040159_0040311 UH COORDINATING THE MEETING
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0040311_0040876 HE'S UH PUSHING THE MEETING FORWARD THEN THIS KIND OF S ORGAN ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OR PART
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0040876_0042313 UH UH AND ALSO OTHER PR UH PARTS LIKE UH THE BACK CHANNELS WITHOUT ANY UH SEMANTIC CONTENT UH FROM OTHER PARTICIPANTS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0042313_0043884 SO THIS KIND OF UH INTERACTION MIGHT BE BETTER ANALYSED AS MONOLOGUE WHICH UH IN WHICH THERE IS INTERACTION I SUPPOSE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0043884_0043965 SO
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0044228_0044264 UH-HUH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0044615_0044644 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0046024_0046210 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0046210_0046319 YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0046533_0047127 SO YEAH SO THIS IS GOING TO BE BASED ON THE UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0047127_0047853 SO FOR THIS UTTERANCE THE NEXT UTTERANCE IF IT'S FROM ANOTHER PA UH SPEAKER
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0047853_0048943 THEN UH IF IT'S NOT A BACK CHANNEL OR UH SOMETHING SIMILAR THEN IT'S A DIALOGUE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0048943_0049116 SO IF SPEAK CHANGES
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0049116_0049284 SO YEAH SPEAKER CHANGE IS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0049432_0049556 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0049556_0050717 YEAH YEAH B BUT UH SH SHORT UH TURNS UH LIKE MM OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR MIGHT BE THE UH SEG SECOND TYPE OF INTERACTIVITY
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0050717_0050884 THE WEAK INTERACTIVITY
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0050884_0052066 THAT MIGHT NOT BE ANALYSED AS A UH MONOLOGUE BUT AS A DIAL UH NO NO NO WRONG UH NOT AS DIALOGUE BUT AS UM A MONOLOGUE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0052066_0052174 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0052174_0053176 SO FOR THAT PART UH FOR THAT KIND OF BACK CHANNELS WE CAN JUST SKIP THAT AND UH UH TO NOT TREAT THEM AS INTERRUPTIONS OR SOMETHING LIKE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0053176_0053406 THEN YEAH WE COULD JUST UH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0054059_0054105 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0054266_0054313 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0054598_0054916 SPEAK CHANGE SPEAK CHANGE WOULD BE YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0055585_0056750 IF IF IT'S UH JUST SOME KIND OF BACK CHANNEL OR IT'S JUST A SIGNAL SIGNAL THE S THE SPEAKER IS LISTENING OR IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0056750_0056783 YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0057341_0057363 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0057551_0057590 UH-HUH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0057904_0057999 UM
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0059092_0059150 YEAH SO
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0059301_0059384 UH YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0059384_0059698 UH SO FOR INTERACTIVITY THIS IS THE ONLY SLIDE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0059698_0060412 SO YEAH ACTIVITY IS UH I'D DEFINE INTERACTIVITY TO BE AS A DEGREES OF INTERACTION IN MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0060412_0061007 SO WHICH MIGHT UH SPEAK CHANGE WHI UH UH WOULD BE A VERY GOOD INDICATOR YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0061217_0061239 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0061391_0061497 YEAH YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0061774_0062025 NO NO
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0062025_0062071 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0062071_0062140 NO YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0062140_0062501 SO ACTUALLY SO UH THIS IS A VERY ROUGH IDEA OF INTERACTIVITY
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0062501_0063263 IF WE GO FURTHER WE MIGHT DISTINGUISH UH THE INTERACTIVITY BETWEEN TWO F THREE OR ALL THE GROUPS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0063263_0063880 SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME FINAL DEFINITION FOR THE UH INTERACTIVITY YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0064452_0064658 YEAH SO THAT MIGHT BE THE SECOND CLASS YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0064658_0064921 WEAK THIS IS A KIND OF WEAK INTERACTIVITY
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0064921_0064999 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0064999_0065042 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0067166_0067399 YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0068364_0068536 YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S ALSO TRUE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0068536_0068595 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0068595_0068840 S YEAH YEAH ACTUALLY 'CAUSE UH I'VE LOOKED UH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0069122_0069178 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0069742_0069799 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0070025_0070076 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0070076_0070658 SO FOR THAT CASE YEAH UH YEAH SO THIS MIGHT BE A WEAK DEFINITION OF INTERACTIVITY
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0070658_0071966 SO IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT UH IF THEY ARE REALLY INTERACTI UH INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER OR JUST UH UH INCREMENTAL MM PRESENTATION OF SOME INFORMATION
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0071966_0072102 SO THAT'S D UH DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0072102_0072829 WE MIGHT UM YEAH NEED A MORE STRICT OR FINER UH DEFINITION OF INTERACTIVITY
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0072829_0073616 YEAH JU UH FOR THIS USE OF THE UH FOR THE USE OF THIS TERM FOR THE INDICATOR OF THE UH DEGREES OF INTERACTION
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0073616_0074485 UH I THINK FOR FOR THE CURRENT UH PROPOSAL I THINK THAT IT'S JUST FOR DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIALOGUES AND MONOLOGUES
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0074485_0075066 'CAUSE FOR THESE TWO TYPES OF DISCOURSE UH THE UH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0075224_0075858 THE THE CONS THE THE TWO THAT WE ARE GOING TO ANALYSE THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE MIGHT BE D DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0076049_0076150 YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0076665_0076814 YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0076814_0077346 AND ALSO 'CAUSE UH I HAVE UH READ SOME OF THE M. O. T. A. UH CORPUS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0077346_0078665 UH SO FOR SOME PART OF TH THAT KIND OF MEETINGS UM UH SEVERAL UTTERANCES OR DIALOGUE ACTS ARE JUST UH TAGGED AS STATEMENT
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0078665_0079207 SO THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY INFORMATIVE FOR HIGH LEVEL STR ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0079207_0079779 SO THAT'S ALL WHAT UH THAT'S WHY WHY UH I'M DISTINGUISHING THE TWO KINDS OF DISCOURSE HERE

AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0149465_0150303 IF WE NEED MORE THEN WE MIGHT USE SOME MORE FINER UH F FINER UH DEFINITION FOR INTERACTIVITY
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0150670_0150717 YEAH

AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0160663_0161710 SO MM SO FOR DIALOGUE YEAH MM THERE WOULD BE UH SOME KIND OF UH INTERACTION STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0161710_0163119 SO IT FOR UH IN PREVIOUS DISCOURSE STUDIES UH ESPECIALLY IN DISCOURSE ANALYSIS EXCHANGE UH IS USED TO DESCRIBE THIS KIND OF UH LOCAL STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0163119_0163853 AND IN CONVERSATION THE ANALYSIS SO ADJACENCY PAIRS ARE USED TO DESCRIBE THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0163853_0163937 UH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0164183_0165335 BUT UH IN THESE TWO STRANDS OR WORK THEY UH JUST COME UP WITH A LIST MAYBE NOT UH EXHAUSTIVE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0165335_0167392 SO UH I'M BEEN THINK ABOUT UH IF WE COULD COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF MORE PRINCIPAL SCHEME UH TAKING SOME OF THE UH INFORMATION IN THE UH UH UH IN THE UH INTERACTION UH INTO ACCOUNT
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0167392_0168373 LIKE UH IS THE SMALL PART OF INTERACTION IS IS EXCHANGING SOME INFORMATION
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0168424_0168797 UH HERE INFORMATION IS A LITTLE VAGUE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0168797_0169908 IT COULD BE SOME KIND OF KNOWLEDGE WHAT THE UH SPEAKER KNOWS OR OR SOME KIND OF THOUGHT WHAT THE SPEAKER IS THINKING
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0169908_0170617 SO THESE TWO KIND OF UH INFORM MM TWO KINDS OF THE INFORMATION UH MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF A DIFFERENCE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0170617_0171321 SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE BELL'S MM EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION UH FOR THE KNOWLEDGE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0171321_0172011 IF EXCHANGE OF UH OPINION UH UH SOME KIND OF SO IT'S UH VERY RELATED TO THOUGHT OF THINKING YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0172579_0173739 UH IN SOME CASE IT S DIFFERS 'CAUSE UH WHEN WE EXCHANGE KNOWLEDGE WE MIGHT NOT CHALLENGE UH THE SPEAKER
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0173739_0174594 BUT UH WHEN THE SPEAKER IS UH PRE UH IS UH TALK ABOUT WHAT HE FEELS WHAT HE THINKS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0174594_0175358 IS PROPOSING SOMETHING OR S UH THEN OTHER SPEAKERS MIGHT MIGHT CHAN CHALLENGE HIM OR HER
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0175514_0175613 SO THAT KIND OF STRUCTU
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0175794_0175900 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0175900_0175922 YEAH

AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0177168_0177750 BUT UH THAT MIGHT B BE SOME DIFFERENCE INTER INTERACTION PAR PATTERNS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0177750_0177839 MIGHT BE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0177839_0178922 'CAUSE UH FOR INFORMATION IF WE UH SOMEBODY'S UH SEEKING SOME INFORMATION THEN HE UH ASK SOME QUESTION AND UH THE ONE KNOWS WILL UH GIVES GIVES THE ANSWER
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0178922_0179639 BUT UH UH FOR THE UH OPINION OR THOUGHT UH STUFF
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0179639_0180611 THEN THE SPEAKER MIGHT JUST UH UH PRESENT SOME IDEA AND OTHERS WILL COMMENT OR UH CHALLENGE UH THE IDEA

AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0184519_0185785 MM SEE 'CAUSE UH SO FAR I'M S STILL LOOKING FOR A UH SO CALLED PRINCIPAL SCHEME FOR THE INTERACTION UH FOR THE INTERACTION
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0185785_0185864 SO
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0186145_0186211 YEAH SO

AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0186892_0187306 YEAH SO YEAH FOR UH P UH THE DISCOURSE ANALYSIS THEY'RE USING EXCHANGE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0187306_0188121 BUT UH THEY HAVE NO UH NO CLASSIFICATION JUST TO COME UP WITH OKAY SO UH YOU MEAN UH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0188271_0188459 UH SINCLAIR AND COULTHARD
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0188459_0188536 THAT IS
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0188536_0189113 ALSO AT GENEVA SCHOOL THEY I DON'T THINK THEY LIST SOME KIND OF EXCHANGE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0189113_0190500 BUT UH THE UH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE UH AND UH YEAH EXCHANGE IS FIRST UH DEVELOPED IN UH SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR ALONG THE UH UH HALLIDAY AND AND MARTIN'S WORK
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0190500_0190523 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0190523_0191293 SO UH ACTUALLY THEY THEY HAVE SOME SOMETHING IN IN A TEXTBOOK ABOUT THE EXCHANGE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0191293_0191508 UH THEY CALL IT NEGOTIATION
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0191508_0192268 SO THEY HAVE UH SOME FLOW CHARTS OF THE UH UH DETAILED ANALYSIS OF UH UH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0192944_0192997 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0193306_0194185 SO UM UH I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY KIND OF PRINCIPLE CLASSIFICATION OF EXCHANGES
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0194185_0194361 THIS IS I YEAH W

AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0200680_0201464 MM 'CAUSE UH FROM MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WE SEE ANANYS ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION SEEKING DIALOGUES OVER TELEPHONES

AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0201907_0203624 SO FROM UH UM MY ANALYSIS OF THAT KIND OF DIALOGUES I COULD SAY THAT THERE'S ONLY THERE ONLY FOUR BASIC UH EXCHANGES DEPEND ON THE INFORMATION UH DIRECTION OF THE INFORMATION FLOW
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0203624_0203823 AND ALSO THE SPEAKER ROLE
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0203867_0204501 'CAUSE IN THE INFORMATION SEEKING DIALOGUES THE UH T ROLES OF THE TWO PARTICIPANTS ARE DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2005a_H00_MEO082_0204501_0205013 ONE IS MAINLY THE UH FROM THE UH AGENCY A TOURISM AGENCY

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0001359_0001785 I THINK THEY PROBABLY OUGHT TO BUT UH THEY WELL
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0001785_0002254 THEY'VE ONLY JUST STARTED REALISING THAT TREATING THIS AS A LEGAL ISSUE IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT WAY TO LOOK AT IT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0002254_0003044 SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UP FOR UNDERSTANDING UM THE INTRICACIES OF THE COMMITTEE I GUESS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0003044_0003409 I MEAN I YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY COULD BUT IT'S R IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE HARD WORK
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0003409_0003531 THE LAW ISN'T VERY CLEAR
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0003803_0003957 THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0003957_0004191 THEY P THEY UH THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0004191_0004420 IT'S JUST IT'S SO STRAPPED NOW UM YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0004420_0005166 LIKE THE CITIZENS ADVICE BUREAU IS SO HARD TO ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO BECAUSE THEY'VE THEY HAVE SO MANY CASES AND SO FEW PEOPLE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0005166_0005536 SO BUT YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY THE NEXT THING THEY'LL HAVE TO DO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0007194_0007214 M
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0008747_0008766 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0008959_0008990 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0008990_0009426 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0009426_0009569 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0009569_0010815 WELL UM I THOUGHT THE RIGHT THING TO DO WAS TO REVIEW WHAT WEI XUN'S BEEN DOING IN THE AREA OF DIALOGUE STRUCTURE FOR WORK PACKAGE ONE OVER THE LAST PERIOD
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0010815_0011832 SO BASICALLY FOR HIM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HE WHAT PROGRESS HE'S BEEN MAKING AND THEN FOR US TO UM FOR HI FOR HIM TO DESCRIBE WHAT WORK HE INTENDS OVER THE NEXT PERIOD OF THE PROJECT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0011832_0012187 AND FOR US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HELP HE NEEDS WITH THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0012187_0013121 UM M MAYBE GIVE HIM SOME HELP FIGURING OUT WHAT PUBLICATIONS HE'S GONNA UM GET OUT OF THIS AND FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT IT FITS INTO THE OVERALL PROJECT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0013178_0013902 SO UM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA DO EVERYTHING TODAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0013902_0015078 BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SORT OF ALL ALIGNED ON WHAT HE WAS DOING AT THE MOMENT AND AND THEN SORT OF FIGURED OUT HOW TO GIVE HIM THE BEST ADVICE COMING UP
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0015078_0015286 SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY I CALLED THIS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0044114_0044246 I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0044246_0045110 SO UM WHEN YOU SAY INTERACTIVITY DO YOU MEAN UM WELL HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERISE A HIGHLY INTERACTIVE MEETING
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0045110_0045349 WHAT ARE THE MEASUREMENTS YOU'D APPLY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0045349_0045967 SO YOU I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SEGMENTING MEETINGS INTO HIGHLY INTERACTIVE PARTS AND NOT SO INTERACTIVE PARTS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0045967_0046304 WHERE YOU THINK SOME OF THEM ARE LIKE A BIT LIKE DIALOGUE AND SOME ARE A BIT LIKE MONOLOGUE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0046304_0046675 SO WHAT MEASUREMENTS WOULD YOU APPLY TO UM FIND OUT WHICH IS WHICH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0049193_0049554 SO YOU MEAN RELATIVELY SHORT TURNS AND SPEAKER CHANGE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0052194_0052211 S
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0053420_0054260 SO SO AM I RIGHT IN THINKING YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN SEGMENT MEETINGS MAYBE INTO TWO T TYPES OF AREAS INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0054260_0054632 SO WHAT ARE TH WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTERACTIVE AREAS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0054632_0055663 SO W SO OKAY SO BUT YOU JUST SAID I THINK THAT YOU WOULD CHARACTERISE SHORT TURNS AS BEING THE NON INTERACTIVE PARTS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0056499_0056732 OH OKAY WELL WE WE CAN DISCOUNT BACK CHANNELS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0056732_0057185 I MEAN UH C ARE YOU IS IT OKAY IF WE TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE 'CAUSE I'M CONFUSED
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0057185_0057292 OR OR DO YOU GET A C
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0057525_0057591 ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0057591_0057609 ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0058062_0058175 'CAUSE IF THIS IS ALL WE'VE GOT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0058175_0058969 I THINK WE SHOULD UH HAVE INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE ON THE BOARD AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT PROPERTIES GOING TO EACH JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR WHAT THE TWO MEAN
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0058969_0059005 UH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0060405_0060499 WELL UH OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0061004_0061321 BUT ARE YOU YOU NEED TO BE MORE PRECISE WHAT YOU MEAN BY SPEAKER CHANGE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0061321_0061822 SO Y DO YOU MEAN ALL OF THE SPEAKERS ARE INVOLVED IN IT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0061822_0061998 IS IT SUFFICIENT FOR TWO SPEAKERS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0061998_0062126 RIGHT AND THEN
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0064648_0065005 OKAY BUT THAT'S N YOU CAN THAT'S DEFINITIONAL RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0065005_0065557 SO SO I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY CONSIDER THAT TO CHANGE THE TURNS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0065557_0065711 THOSE ARE JUST BACK CHANNELS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0065711_0067451 SO ONE SPEAKER WILL HAVE THE FLOOR CHANNEL UM THROUGHOUT THAT AND SO I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE INTERACTIVE SECTIONS WOULD HAVE SHORTER SPEAKER TURNS WHEN YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING THE BACK CHANNELS AS INTERRUPTIONS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0067451_0067708 UM SO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0068774_0068838 WELL DO Y
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0069094_0069155 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0069155_0069327 SUFFICIENT BUT NOT NECESSARY MAYBE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0069327_0070049 IT DEPEND IF YOU HAD SO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ALL JUST GIVING INFORMATION AND OPINION AROUND THE TABLE AND THEY NEVER ACTUALLY ASK QUESTIONS OF EACH OTHER
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0070049_0070336 BUT THE TURNS WERE ACTUALLY QUITE SHORT WHICH ONE WOULD IT BE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0071965_0072002 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0075891_0075946 RIGHT OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0075946_0076105 I REMEMBER YOU SAYING THIS BEFORE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0076105_0076796 SO BASICALLY YOU WANT TO DO THE SEGMENTATION BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANALYSES TO THE TWO SECTIONS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0076796_0076855 UM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0079772_0079834 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0079834_0081123 SO WEI XUN QUITE TAKES QUITE A STRONG POSITION ON UM THIS UM DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO UM KINDS OF GROUP ACTIVITIES BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT THEY ADMIT DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANALYSES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0081123_0082421 RIGHT THE WITH THE NON INTERACTIVE MORE MONOLO MONO LOGIC SECTIONS OF THE MEETING UM YOU HAVE TO UH ANALYSE THEM USING SOMETHING AKIN TO RHETORICAL STRUCTURE OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0082421_0083244 AND UH WITH THE OTHER SECTIONS YOU UH UM YOU YOU USE SOME OTHER THEORY TO LOOK AT THEM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0083244_0084756 AND I ACTUALLY UH THINK THAT THAT'S A SLIGHTLY EXTREME UM POSITION UM WITH REGARD TO THE LITERATURE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHO THE DIFFERENT SPEAKERS ARE IN AN INTERACTIVE SECTION
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0084756_0085759 YOU CAN STILL UM BUILD MAYBE THE THE SAME ARGUMENT STRUCTURE OVER THE TOP OF THE BASIC UM ACTS AND PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT THAT'S THERE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0085809_0086734 AND UH WHAT YOU GET IS A MESSIER VERSION OF THE ARGUMENT STRUCTURE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME ARGUMENT IN THEIR BRAIN YOU KNOW FOR THIS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0086734_0087447 BUT UM BUT THAT THE SAME THEORY OR THE THE SAME ANALYSIS CAN BE APPLIED TO BOTH PARTS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0087447_0087759 SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP UM THAT IN MIND
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0087759_0088734 AND IF YOU IF YOU DO NEED TO ARGUE THAT THESE TWO KINDS OF GROUP ACTIVITIES UH CAN CAN ONLY BE ANALYSED IF YOU USE DIFFERENT ANALYTICAL MECHANISMS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0088734_0089008 THEN YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0089008_0089279 RIGHT SO IT IT PUTS AN EXTRA BURDEN OF PROOF ON THE WORK THAT YOU DO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0089682_0089699 MM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0091568_0091595 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0091748_0092132 BUT TO THE GROU DEGREE THAT A GROUP IS BUILDING AN ARGUMENT TOGETHER
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0092132_0092856 I MEAN IT I THINK WH WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN A GROUP DISCUSSION ISN'T NECESSARILY ONE COHERENT ARGUMENT F FOR THE PERSON
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0092856_0093188 BUT AN ARGUMENT THAT IS THE GROUP VIEW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0093188_0094049 AND SO IT'S MAYBE IT'S NOT R. S. T. UM BUT IT'S UM MORE AKIN TO UM I DON'T KNOW IS IT TOOLMAN
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0094049_0094536 BUT YOU KNOW NOT THAT I BUT YOU KNOW THE KINDS OF THINGS WHERE PEOPLE TO TRY TO REPRESENT ARGUMENT STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0095805_0096161 ARE ARE THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF IT FOR THIS ANALYSIS REALLY THAT SUBSTANTIVELY DIFFERENT THOUGH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0097018_0097359 BUT I IF SOMEBODY IF THERE'S BEEN AN ARGUMENT SO FAR IN A GROUP MEETING
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0097359_0097842 AND UM SOMEBODY MAKES A STATEMENT THEY HAVE AN INTENTION ABOUT HOW TO MODIFY THAT GROUP ARGUMENT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0098833_0098933 RIGHT BUT BUT YOU'RE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0099527_0099898 OKAY SO THE R THE RELATION NAMES AREN'T AREN'T RIGHT BUT UM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0100587_0100637 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0101739_0101777 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0103206_0103373 WELL THE RELATION NAMES ARE LESS IMPORTANT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0103373_0103704 I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED FOR AGES ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT RELATIONS WERE IN ANY OF THESE THEORIES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0103704_0104103 AND THAT'S THAT'S LESS IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE THEORY IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0104103_0105103 AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE TWO DIF SEPARATE APPARATUSES FOR THE UM SPEAKER INTERNAL UM ARGUMENT STRUCTURE AND THE GROUP ARGUMENT STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0105103_0105622 THAT THAT'S MORE APPARA APPARATUS THAN YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY NEED FOR UM FROM DOING THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0105622_0106241 'CAUSE IN BOTH CASES YOU'RE UM BUILDING UP AN ARGUMENT PUBLICLY IN THIS GROUP MEETING AND THEN YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0106241_0107096 ADDING SOMETHING OR CHANGING THE EXISTING ARGUMENT IN SOME WAY BY RELATING A CONTRIBUTION TO WHAT'S UM ALREADY ON THE TABLE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0107096_0107148 SO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0107959_0107990 MM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0109878_0110703 YEAH C I JUST THINK WELL I MEAN IT ALL OF THESE THINGS WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER A NEW GENRE OF UM OF UH ACTUAL DATA
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0110703_0111284 THEN THEY END UP MODIFYING BUILDING NEW KINDS OF RELATIONS WITH NEW KINDS OF SEMANTICS AND ADDING THEM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0111284_0111445 THAT'S THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THESE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0112397_0112428 MM-HMM

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0120964_0121999 SO THERE YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY WHO'S DOING THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD CLAIM THAT YOU DON'T NEED TWO SEPARATE AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS FOR THESE TWO TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT WEI XUN HAS IDENTIFIED
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0122148_0122182 YEAH

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0127781_0128789 I JUST PREFER IT TO BE ONE THING RATHER THAN TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE THINGS AND THEN THE ADDED EXPLANATION OF WHY IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE SAME THING APPLIED TO BOTH HALVES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0131706_0131775 HMM YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0133042_0133082 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0134012_0134039 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0134477_0135217 YEAH WHICH WOULDN'T PROBABLY WOULDN'T GIVE US THE KIND OF UM INFORMATION THAT WE NEED ABOUT RELATIONS ACROSS TURNS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0135217_0136583 JUST BECAUSE WE REALLY ARE CRITICALLY INTERESTED IN THE ARGUMENT UM THAT THE GROUP IS BUILDING UP SO THAT WE CAN FIND THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE AND UM ANY P UH COUNTER PROPOSALS TO PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND THINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0136583_0137552 I MEAN IT REALLY IS MORE IN THE SPIRIT UH OF THE R. S. T. ISH RELATIONS THAN UM THAN IN THE DAMSEL KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0137552_0138025 WHAT WE WANT UH OUT OF THE C UM THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPEAKERS HERE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0138025_0138222 THEY ARE JOINTLY BUILDING UP AN ARGUMENT STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0138222_0138712 AND THAT IS THE CRITICAL THING THAT WE'RE MISSING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO UM UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0138916_0139339 SO WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T WANNA DO THE SAME THING AS WHAT UM SHE DID IN THIS CASE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0139339_0139843 BEC JUST BECAUSE UM DAMSEL DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT SORT OF REPRESENTATION BETWEEN SPEAKERS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0140306_0140371 OH DOES IT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0140371_0140695 OKAY UM I HAVEN'T SEEN IT ON THAT THIS KIND OF DATA
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0140695_0140765 SO MAYBE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0141190_0141815 RIGHT OKAY BUT ARE WHAT I MEAN IS YOU KNO WANNA MAKE SURE YOU GET THE ARGUMENTATIVE RELATIONS HOWEVER YOU DO IT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0141815_0142052 WHICHEVER RELATIONS YOU HAVE TO BUILD YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0142052_0142588 NOT I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR SET OF TAGS OR RELATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFINED OUT THERE THAT ARE THE RIGHT ONES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0142588_0142961 I'M JUST SAYING WE NEED THE CORRECT ONES FOR TH THE STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0142961_0143224 'CAUSE WE NEED CERTAIN INFORMATION OUT OF THIS ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0143224_0143259 THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0144236_0144272 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0144807_0144956 WELL WEI XUN'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE DATA
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0144956_0145173 SO THAT'S THAT'S A STEP FOR THIS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0147482_0147508 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0147835_0147870 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0148507_0148575 MM-HMM YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0150385_0150676 WELL WHAT YOU'LL NEED IN THE END IS SOMETHING OPERATIONAL
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0150676_0151669 SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN USE TO ACTUALLY SEGMENT MEETINGS INTO THE UM THE AREAS THAT YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR THIS ANALYSIS RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0151669_0152314 SO UM IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR TO ME WHAT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0152314_0152834 SO IT WOULD BE I THINK HANDY IF YOU COULD TAKE A MEETING AT SOME POINT AND SAY YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0152834_0153467 THIS IS A INTERACTIVE AREA AND THIS IS A MONO LOGIC AREA BECAUSE AND WE COULD COME UP WITH WHAT KINDS OF MEASUREMENTS YOU NEED
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0153535_0154242 UM I MEAN WE HAVE W WE HAVEN'T DONE PAST WORK HERE ON SEGMENTING MEETINGS IN THAT WAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0154242_0154880 BUT WE HAVE DONE WORK ON CHARACTERISING DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEETINGS UM IN TERMS OF HOW HIGHLY INTERACTIVE THEY ARE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0154880_0155071 BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT DEFINITION RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0155071_0156645 IT'S IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE MEETING UM TAKE SOME TAKE EQUAL PART IN IT AS OPPOSED TO UM LIKE THE HIGHEST STATE IS PEOPLE IN THE MEETING JUST DRIVING IT AND AND UH THE OTHER PEOPLE FOLLOWING WHATEVER THE HIGH STATE IS PEOPLE WANT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0156692_0157133 SO UM BUT THOSE KINDS OF MEASURES UM YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0157133_0157962 WE COULD USE TO UM TO DO THIS KIND OF SEGMENTATION IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE ANALYSIS RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0157962_0158506 W BUT WE NEED CLEARER DEFINITIONS OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT THINGS ARE HOW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OF UM ACTIVITIES ARE THERE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0158506_0159169 YOU KNOW IS IT JUST INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE OR IS THERE ARE THERE THERE MORE GRADES OF SHADING THAN THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0159169_0159435 AND UM YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU EXPECT IN EACH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0159435_0159616 WHAT'S THE BACK CHANNELLING BEHAVIOUR
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0159616_0160106 WHAT'S THE SPEAKER TURN UM YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF DIALOGUE ACTS DO YOU EXPECT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0160106_0160355 I THINK THAT WOULD HELP YOU PIN DOWN WHAT THE DEFINITIONS ARE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0172053_0172579 DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS WHETHER SOMETHING IS KNOWLEDGE OR OPINION IN THE WAY IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROUP PROCESS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0175468_0175516 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0175516_0176371 I I SORT OF HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN THE VIEW THAT UM THAT WELL PEOPLE AREN'T VERY GOOD AT AT THIS KIND OF RATIONALITY YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0176371_0177065 AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION AND OPINION ISN'T THAT PROMINENT IN THE WAY PEOPLE DO THEIR REASONING
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0177065_0177257 SO UM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0180457_0180489 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0180611_0180896 WELL YOU YOU CAN'T DEFINE 'EM THAT WAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0180896_0181684 YOU CAN'T DEFINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION AND OPINION THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT'S UM BASICALLY DEFINING AS THE WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT IT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0181684_0182192 AND I THINK WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT UM IF PEOPLE CHALLENGE THE THE FACTS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0182192_0183167 YOU OFTEN DISCOVER THAT THEY WEREN'T ACTUALLY SOLID FACTS ANYWAY YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE I THINK THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THESE IS KIND OF FLUID
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0183167_0183789 SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS IT IMPORTANT TO WHAT WHAT'S IT IMPORTANT TO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0183789_0184409 SO DO YOU NEED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION AND OPINION TO DO THIS ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0185906_0186020 SO WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING AT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0186504_0186789 SO YOU'RE YOU'VE GOT BOOKS THAT HIGH ON YOUR DESK
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0186789_0186872 WHICH ONES ARE THEY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0190093_0190129 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0190445_0190468 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0191615_0191627 MM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0192246_0192296 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0192296_0192951 SO Y UM I'M SORT OF GETTING THAT YOU THINK THERE IS A LACK IN THE UH THEORY TO DO WITH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0192951_0193290 BUT I'M BUT I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR YET WHAT YOU THINK THE LACK IS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0193290_0193355 SO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0194373_0194930 UM THE WELL ARE YOU THINKING IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE READ THIS LITERATURE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0194930_0195739 BUT I MEAN MY UNDERSTANDING OF EXCHANGE IS IS THAT THE INITIATING MOVE INTRODUCES A GOAL TO THE DISCOURSE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0195739_0197278 AND THEN THE REMAINING MOVES UM WILL UH CONTRIBUTE TO EITHER THE UM THE MEETING OF THAT DISCOURSE GOAL OR THE DECISION NOT TO BOTHER WITH THAT DISCOURSE GOAL
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0197278_0197348 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0197348_0197924 AND SO UM I'D BE SURPRISED IF THERE WASN'T WORK DESCRIBING
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0198013_0198094 THINGS IN THOSE TERMS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0198094_0198625 I MEAN I KNOW SINCLAIR AND COULTHARD IS IS BASICALLY ABOUT TEACHING YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0198625_0199538 SO YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT TO NECESSARILY UM APPLY UH IN IN WIDER CONTACTS IN A WAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0199538_0199893 LIKE YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO HAVE TO EXTEND THE THEORY TO DO THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0199893_0200655 BUT I TH I THINK THERE ARE OTHER OTHER PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AND DESCRIBED IT IN THESE TERMS IN A WAY THAT SHOULD REALLY SUIT YOUR NEEDS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0201461_0201497 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0201922_0201952 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0203116_0203147 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0205404_0205442 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0207412_0207448 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0207642_0208356 SO THIS IS A L A LOT LIKE GEORGE HORTON'S WORK ON SAYING WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS FOR UM THESE EXCHANGES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0208356_0208685 YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT CHARACTERISE THE SET OF EXCHANGES THAT CAN HAPPEN
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0208685_0208719 MM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0209890_0211056 SO SO IS YOUR COMPLAINT LESS ABOUT UM LESS ABOUT KNOWING WHAT MAKES AN EXCHANGE AND MORE ABOUT KNOWING HOW YOU PARAMETERISE EXCHANGES FOR THIS GENRE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0211056_0211151 SO WHAT'S THE RANGE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0211151_0211678 OKAY SO YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S THE RANGE OF EXCHANGE TYPES FOR THIS GENRE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK HASN'T BEEN DONE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0211678_0211748 UH-HUH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0211748_0211801 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0211801_0211865 THAT'S CLEARER
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0212594_0212634 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0214615_0214742 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0214742_0215780 SO SO HAVE HAVE YOU TRIED I MEAN UM I KNOW OF ONE PREVIOUS ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH WHAT EXCHANGES ARE NEEDED FOR F UM SOME KINDS OF INDUSTRY MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0215780_0216725 AND OUR EXPERIENCE IN THAT PROJECT WAS THAT UM YOU CAN'T REALLY IDENTIFY EXCHANGE STRUCTURES IN THESE MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T REALLY FOLLOW THAT PATTERN
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0216725_0217509 THAT EXCHANGES ARE CLEAR IN UM WELL I THERE'RE CLEARER IN WHEN YOU'VE GOT FEWER PEOPLE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0217509_0217948 SO THERE'S FEWER PEOPLE TRYING TO PULL THE DISCOURSE GOALS IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0217948_0218427 UM AND THEY'RE CLEARER WHEN UM YOUR GOALS ARE QUITE LIMITED
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0218427_0219178 SO WHEN YOU'VE JUST GOT INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND YOU KNOW THE OR THERE'S A CLEAR TASK THAT THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO AND THEY'RE FOCUSSED ON THAT TASK
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0219178_0219542 AS IS NORMAL IN DIALOGUE ELICITATION LIKE MAP TASK OR LIKE YOUR
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0219638_0220330 LIKE YOUR INFORMA WHICH LIKE YOUR INFORMATION SEEKING DIALOGUES WHICH WASN'T DIALOGUE ELICITATION BUT IT WAS VERY CONSTRAINED IN GENRE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0220330_0221633 SO UM THE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION MIGHT BE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE CATALOGUE OF EXCHANGES IS FOR REAL MEETINGS BECAUSE UM OR FOR THESE DECISION MAKING MEETINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY EXCHANGES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0221633_0221657 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0221657_0222333 SO HAVE YOU GONE THROUGH THE MEETINGS AND LOOKED FOR INITIATIONS AND RESPONSES WITH WITHOUT A PRIOR CATALOGUE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0222333_0223301 JUST KNOWING THAT INIT INITIATION IN INTRODUCES A NEW DISCOURSE GOAL AND A RESPONSE UM MEETS OR NEGATES THAT GOAL IN SOME WAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0223301_0223537 SO HAVE YOU TRIED MARKING THESE EXCHANGES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0224076_0224112 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0226956_0227014 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0227014_0227200 BUT BUT A READING OF THIS YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0227200_0227937 TH COULD TELL YOU THAT THERE IS NO CASE WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR INITIATION AND RESPONSES THAT'S GONNA WORK YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0227937_0228863 'CAUSE YOU COULD GO THROUGH AND SEE THAT UM ACTUALLY THE PATTERN OF OF ADDRESSING DIFFERENT DISCOURSE GOALS IS TOO DISPERSED TO UM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF MARK UP
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0228863_0229446 BUT I G YEAH I MEAN I OBVIOUSLY YOU WANNA HAVE A FRONT RUNNER SCHEME I IN MIND BEFORE YOU
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0230519_0230586 SO THAT'S IT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0230751_0230784 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0235553_0236169 DO YOU MEAN AN ACTION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE GROUP IS REQUIRING HIM TO DO OR DO YOU MEAN AN ACTION IN LIKE PICKING SOMETHING UP
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0236403_0236826 SO ACTION IN THE TECHNICAL MEETING SENSE OR JUST ACTION IN THE PHYSICAL SENSE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0236826_0236892 RIGHT OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0244329_0244673 OH SO THAT'S NOT A PHYSICAL ACTION RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0244673_0245261 UH UH IF I PICK THIS UP WHICH IS A PHYSICAL ACTION YOU CAN'T REJECT THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0245261_0245331 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0246663_0246704 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0246704_0247081 THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S A ACTION IN THE SORT OF TECHNICAL SENSE OF MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0247081_0247782 SO YOU ARE ACTIONED TO DO SOMETHING WHICH IS PART OF THE PERMANENT RECORD THAT YEAH OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0249282_0250551 WELL THERE ARE VERY FEW UH SCHEMES FOR MARKING UP EXCHANGES ON ACTUAL DATA RIGHT BECAUSE UM PEOPLE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED IT VERY IMPORTANT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0250551_0251087 WELL I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY GET TIRED AFTER MARKING UP THE DIALOGUE MOVES SO THEY NEV NEVER BOTHER WITH ANY HIGHER LEVEL DIALOGUE STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0251087_0251210 SO WE DID IT IN THE MAP TASK
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0251210_0251923 BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW OF OTHER CASES WHERE PEOPLE BOTHERED MARKING ANYTH ANYTHING HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE MAP THAN THE MOVE STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0251923_0252039 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0252039_0252101 YOU DON'T KNOW OF
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0252376_0252525 ON YEAH I'VE S UH SORRY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0252525_0253075 UM BUT IT C IT'S NOT BEEN VERY POPULAR CAR PROBABLY 'CAUSE IT MAKES UM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0267581_0267630 DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0272871_0272958 MM-HMM YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0273117_0273659 WELL THE FIRST STEP IS FIND OUT IN THE WHAT HOW MUCH OF THE MATERIAL DOES THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING COVER
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0273659_0273868 SO HOW MUCH OF A GENRE CLASH IS THERE HERE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0276367_0276419 WELL IT'S
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0277025_0277078 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0277078_0277606 B TH BUT THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD THAT ARE MOVING THAT DIRECTION LIKE MARTIN
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0277606_0278181 AND ALSO WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THE THEORETICAL CLARITY ABOUT WHAT AN INITIATION AND A RESPONSE IS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0278181_0278776 SO WHAT IS IT THAT TIES UM DIFFERENT ACTS TOGETHER AT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0279575_0279607 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0280755_0281965 BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOOKING AT UM WHETHER PARTS OF THE MEETING ARE HIGHLY INTERACTIVE OR NOT SO INTERACTIVE IS UH LOOKING AT WHAT SORT OF TASK THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0281965_0282049 SO YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0282049_0283615 ARE THEY DOING UM UH I ARE ARE THEY UH I AS IN THE KICK OFF MEETING JUST EXCHANGING INFORMATION TO GET STARTED WITH A PROJECT OR ARE THEY UH ACTUALLY ADDRESSING SOME SPECIFIC DESIGN UM CRITERIA AT THE MOMENT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0283615_0283825 SHOULD TRY TO DECIDE WHICH SHAPE THE THING IS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0283889_0284419 UM BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE KINDS OF RELATIONS THAT YOU GET BETWEEN THE UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0284419_0285384 AND SO THAT IS MUCH MORE LIKE UM THE UM THE LITERATURE FROM MCGRATH ABOUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES GROUPS GET INTO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0285384_0286320 SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT HAS TO BE PULLED INTO THIS BECAUSE UM YOU YOU DO REQUIRE DIFFERENT UH UH DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELATIONS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0286320_0286916 OR YOU EXPECT DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELATIONS FROM SOME OVER ARCHING SET IN UM THOSE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0286916_0286954 UH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0289062_0289260 UM SO WHAT'S THE HIGH LEVEL VERSION AGAIN
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0289260_0289274 P S
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0289670_0289739 RIGHT OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0289739_0290095 I MEAN I THE MEETING ACTIONS IS JUST GONNA BE A SEGMENTATION
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0290095_0290544 IT'S NOT GOING TO PRESENT ANY S ANY MICRO STRUCTURE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0290544_0290819 SO IT'S JUST GONNA SAY FROM HERE TO HERE THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0290819_0291008 THAT'S ALL THAT THAT SCHEME IS GONNA DO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0291371_0291413 W
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0291581_0291631 IT'S N
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0291935_0292279 THAT'S NOT NO THOSE WELL THAT'S INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0292279_0293057 AND THE MEETING ACTIONS ARE MEANT TO B UH BECOME MORE UM SEMANTIC AND MORE THEORETICAL THAN THE KIND IDIAP HAVE TRADITIONALLY USED
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0293057_0293525 SO SO WE NEED TO STILL PRESERVE SOME UH SENSE OF THE ACTIVITY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0293525_0294273 BUT RATHER THAN SAYING IT IS SOMEBODY'S AT THE WHITE BOARD IT'LL BE YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY'S EXPLAINING SOMETHING THAT THE OTHERS ARE FOCUSSED ON
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0294857_0294923 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0295251_0295421 IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT SCHEME

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0296997_0297837 WELL YOU MIGHT NEED THE MEETING ACTION SEGMENTATION IN ORDER TO KNOW WHERE WHAT UH WHAT AREA YOU'RE CIRCUMVENTING FOR SO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0297837_0298422 IT'S JUST EXCHANGE STRUCTURE IN THIS AREA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN THAT'S A SOLID BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE NEXT BIT OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0298422_0298518 I DON'T KNOW

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0308103_0308338 IT'S A LOT CHEAPER THAN DOING DIALOGUE ACT CODING IN THE FIRST PLACE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0308694_0309389 UM RIGHT WELL ONE PRESUMES IT IS OTHERWISE IT'S GONNA BE RA RADICALLY EXPENSIVE TO DO ANY KIND OF MARK UP
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0309389_0310244 SO UM THE YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT BUT YOU NEED TO WHAT WE NEED IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWING

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0319217_0319825 YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE HIGH LEVEL GOAL IN ORDER TO FOCUS THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING RATHER THAN THINKING WELL
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0319825_0320202 YOU KNOW THERE'S THESE THEORIES YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE APPLY THESE THEORIES TO IT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0320202_0320757 UM AND THEN SEEING WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR THE MEETING BROWSER ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0320757_0321477 WE HAVE A GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO DO THIS WITH THE MEETING BROWSER UM WHAT KINDS OF DIALOGUE STRUCTURE WOULD WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0321477_0321678 I MEAN UH I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU'D WANNA DISAGREE WITH THAT

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0330965_0331400 AND IN FAVOUR OF UM THESE THESE MORE ARGUMENTATIVE THINGS

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0406491_0407158 SO HOW MUCH WORK IS THERE LEFT AND WHEN DO WE ACTUALLY NEED IT BY WOULD BE USEFUL TO DISCUSS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0407721_0407926 THE AMI DATA IS IS THERE

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0419404_0419534 SO HE DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0419534_0419853 SO WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH DATA YOU NEED HAND CHUNKED
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0419853_0420147 AND THEN UH HOW DO YOU HAND CHUNK STUFF RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0420147_0420435 SO YOU WERE WERE WORKING ON INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOING HAND CHUNKING

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0420879_0421371 BUT THEN HE THERE WERE TWO POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR UH FOR DOING THIS ON THE AMI DATA
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0421371_0421896 YOU COULD EITHER UM ESSENTIALLY GO THE SAME ROUTE AS THEY DID WITH THE SWITCHBOARD UM YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0421896_0422413 DO THE PENN TREE BANK AND THEN CREATE THE CHUNKS OFF THAT OR YOU COULD CHUNK DIRECTLY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0422413_0422712 AND IT WASN'T CLEAR TO US WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO METHODS WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0423524_0423780 RIGHT WELL SO YOU'D HAVE TO PRODUCE AS PART OF THIS EXERCISE
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0424101_0424272 YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT SO BUT I DUNNO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0424789_0424949 OH YES YEAH I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0425509_0425728 BUT THAT'S NOT VERY SIMILAR
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0425728_0425885 WELL I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT GRAMMAR
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0425885_0426532 IS TH IS THAT SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT THAT THIS SAME METHOD COULD APPLY THAT WE DERIVE CHUNKS OFF THE H. P. S. G. OUTPUT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0427504_0427832 I THINK YOU MIGHT LOSE A LOT IN YOU KNOW THIS STEP
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0427832_0428288 SO BASICALLY YOUR YOUR CHUNKER IS TRAINED ON SOMETHING THAT WAS DERIVED OFF PENN TREE BANK
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0428288_0428755 AND IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT ENOUGH THAT THAT ACTUALLY CAUSES IT NOT TO MATCH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0428755_0429348 YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SUDDENLY EVALUATING AGAINST CHUNKS THAT WERE DONE USING H. P. S. G. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GRAMMAR BUT IT YOU KNOW IT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0430552_0430603 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0430603_0430918 AND THE MAPPINGS ARE CAN BE CR PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR THIS RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0430918_0431255 OR IS IS EASY TO MAP BETWEEN FINER GRAINED DISTINCTIONS AND COARSER ONES
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0431531_0431580 THINK SO
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0432322_0432370 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0436458_0436529 HUH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0436529_0436803 THE NAMES WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS THE IDEA RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0436987_0437014 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0438431_0438457 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0438457_0439530 SO Y THAT SORT OF ASSUMES THAT WE THINK IT'S BETTER TO DO THIS BY DERIVING CHUNKS FROM UM SOME PARSED FORMAT THAN JUST HAND CHUNKING THE STUFF
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0440643_0440692 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0441932_0441971 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0442141_0442285 SO LET'S TRY IT THIS WAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0442285_0442996 AND THEN THAT THAT PUTS OFF THE QUESTION OF UM WHEN DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS TO WHEN WE GET H. P. S. G. STUFF RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0442996_0443868 SO CAN YOU ASK UM D. F. K. I. WHETHER THEY CAN GIVE US A COUPLE AMI MEETINGS RUN THROUGH THEIR H. P. S. G. PROCESS
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0443868_0444049 I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TIME SCALE THEY HAD IN MIND
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0444049_0444703 I MEAN IT IS THIS SOMETHING THEY W THEY WERE DOING IT AT THE MOMENT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS VERY PRELIMINARY OR DO YOU REMEMBER

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0456058_0456897 IF IT DOES ASK D. F. K. I. EITHER FOR DATA OR A TIME SCALE AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH DATA YOU NEED IN ORDER TO DO THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0456897_0457249 SO DO YOU HAVE A TECHNIQUE FOR ESTIMATING HOW MUCH DATA YOU'D NEED
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0457692_0457914 I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT SO WHO KNOWS HOW YOU DO THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0458422_0458457 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0458457_0458927 SO JUST ASK D. F. K. I. HOW MUCH DATA AND WHEN RIGHT

AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0460880_0461282 UH WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR TIME IN MIND WHEN WE NEED A CHUNKER THAT WORKS ON THIS STUFF
AMI_EN2005a_H01_FEE083_0461282_0461330 SO

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0057930_0058140 I'M JUST WONDERING IF HE'S PREPARED
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0058938_0059090 SURE

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0059736_0059765 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0063896_0064573 BUT WE'VE ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT IT'S NOT JUST SPEAKER CHANGE IT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE MM-HMM OKAY THEN
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0064845_0064909 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0064909_0065075 Y YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0065906_0065993 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0065993_0066067 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0066067_0066096 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0067852_0068578 WELL IT MIGHT BE THE CASE THAT TO BE INTERACTIVE THERE HAVE TO BE DIALOGUE ACTS OF SOME SPECIFIC TYPE IN A TURN RATHER THAN
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0068852_0069162 LIKE STATEMENT STATEMENT REJECT ACCEPT YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0082431_0082454 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0089366_0089613 WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T QUITE AGREE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0089613_0090733 I MEAN I FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN'T USE R. S. T. ACROSS SPEAKERS BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS OF THE RELATIONS DEPEND ON THE INTENTIONS OF THE SPEAKER AND THERE'S DIFFERENT SPEAKERS HAVE DIFFERENT INTENTIONS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0090733_0090870 SO YOU CAN'T USE THE THEORY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0090870_0091513 IT'S JUST FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG IT'S IT WAS MEANT AS A THEORY FOR A ONE PERSON UH RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0091513_0091827 SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T OTHER THEO SO FOR
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0093172_0093215 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0094428_0094443 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0094443_0095243 BUT THOSE ARE VERY THOSE ARE REALLY DIFFERENT UM THEORIES THAT ARE AT ARE TRYING TO GET AT DIFFERENT THINGS AND IT AND THEY ADMIT OF M YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0095243_0095763 SOME OF THEM ADMIT OF MULTIPLE PARTIES AND SOME OF THEM ASSUME YOU'RE IN ONE SPEAKER'S HEAD
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0095763_0095864 RIGHT AND THE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0096191_0096240 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0096240_0096785 YEAH THE ENTIRE THEORY IS BASED ON INTENTION AND THE INTENTION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0096785_0097025 SO R. S. T. WOULD BE A BAD THEORY TO USE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0097773_0098633 SO MODELLING MODELLING A SINGLE CONTRIBUTION BY A SINGLE SPEAKER YOU CAN WITHIN THAT YOU CAN USE R. S. T. IF YOU WANT TO RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0098633_0098896 BUT ACROSS SPEAKERS YOU CAN'T
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0098896_0099368 THEY HAVE NO RELATIONS FOR THINGS LIKE REJECT OR AGREE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0099368_0099523 THEY THE THEORY DOESN'T HAVE THEM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0099847_0100360 SO THE THE SO IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THEORY 'CAUSE THE THEORY IS THE RELATIONS PLUS THE NOTION OF NUCLEARITY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0100360_0100546 SO WE NEED A DIFFERENT THEORY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0100546_0101159 NOW I THINK ALEX UM S. D. R. S. ALLOWS BOTH KINDS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0101159_0101718 SO YOU KNOW WITHIN A SPEAKER TURN YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE EXPLANATION AND CAUSE AND ALL THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0101718_0102889 UM BUT THEN ACROSS SPEAKER TURNS YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE CORRECTION OR I DIDN'T SEE ANY EXAMPLES OF AGREE OR DISAGREE IN S. T. R. S. BUT I THERE AREN'T
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0102889_0103017 I MEAN THERE ARE THIRTY RELATIONS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0103017_0103172 SO WE SHOULD LOOK AT AT WHAT THEY ARE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0103172_0103289 BUT I D I DON'T
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0103682_0103852 WELL HER THE RELATIONS HAVE A S
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0107147_0107919 D YES BUT SO I MEAN THE RELATION NAMES IT'S NOT THE NAMES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IT'S THEIR SEMANTICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0107919_0108720 AND THEY'RE THE SEMANTICS OF THE RELATIONS ARE BASED ON THE SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCES THAT THEY'RE RELATING AS ALEX S EXPLAINED YESTERDAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0108720_0109861 UM AND SO UM IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THESE RELATIONS HAVE A SEMANTICS THAT'S TIED TO THE SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCES RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0111241_0111816 UH P POSS POSSIBLY BUT FEW PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0111816_0112505 DO THE KIND OF UM TRUTH CONDITIONAL SEMANTICS THAT YOU KNOW ASHER AND LASCARIDES HAVE DONE RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0112505_0113098 SO THE THEORY CAN HANDLE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN MEETINGS AS SHE EXPLAINED
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0113098_0113815 THE ACTUAL COMPUTATIONAL MECHANISMS THEY HAVE CURRENTLY FOR BUILDING UP THE TREES CAN'T
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0113815_0114639 NOW I DON'T REMEMBER WAS WHICH SPEAKER YOU IN THE C IN THE EXAMPLE SHE SHOWED YESTERDAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0114639_0115647 WAS IT THE CASE THAT THE REPRESENTATION OF THE UTTERANCES AND THE RELATIONS INCLUDED WHICH SPEAKER WAS UH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0116036_0116844 I MEAN IT HAD THE AT THE L AT THE LEAVES THEY HAD THE WELL SHE DIDN'T SHOW IT BUT THEY WOULD HAVE THE SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCES
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0116844_0117158 AND THEN SHE HAD RELATION NAMES AND HANDLES
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0117833_0117859 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0117859_0118394 I JUST I JUST DON'T DIDN'T REMEMBER SEEING IN THE REPRESENTATION WHICH SPEAKER CONTRIBUTED WHAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0118394_0119047 'CAUSE SHE DID REPRESENT UM DISCOURSE STRUCTURES 'CAUSE THESE WERE THE VERBMOBIL SCHEDULING DIALOGUES
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0119047_0119881 SO THE UTTERANCES IN THE IN THE REPRESENTATION WERE UTTERED BY TWO DIFFERENT PARTIES THAT WASN'T THE YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0119881_0120592 IN THE IN THE EXAMPLES SHE SHOWED US THERE WERE THERE WAS SOME THAT WAS JUST YOU KNOW ONE PARTY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0120592_0120959 IT WAS A MONOLOGUE BUT THEN THERE WAS A SNIPPET OF DIALOGUE AS WELL WITH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0121928_0122423 FOR THIS SPECIFIC SET OF RELATIONS THAT THAT THEY'VE DEFINED
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0122423_0122742 THERE MIGHT BE SOME HIGHER LEVEL STRUCTURE THAT YOU WANNA PULL OUT OF THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0122742_0123316 I MEAN I 'CAUSE YOU WERE SAYING YOU'RE JUST GONNA YOU YOU'RE YOU WANNA LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW VERY LOCAL STUFF
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0123316_0123750 BUT FROM THAT YOU C ONE WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD PULL OUT SOMETHING HIGH YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0124327_0124611 NO I THINK WORKING FROM THE BOTTOM UP SOUNDS GREAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0124611_0125298 BUT I'M JUST Y I MEAN WHAT YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMEONE SAYING WELL HOW DID THEY DECIDE TO MAKE IT BLUE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0125298_0125869 AND MAYBE THERE WAS A LONG BLOW BY BL AND YOU DON'T YOU KIND OF WANNA ABSTRACT AWAY FROM HE SAID THIS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0125869_0126686 SHE SAID THAT HE SAI YOU KNOW TO ANYWAY I YOU KNOW I MEAN I I DON'T THINK ESPECIALLY UH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0126686_0127464 YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT STEEPED IN THESE THEORIES THAT IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO YOU WHETHER WE USE R. S. T. OR SOMETHING LIKE S. D. R. S.
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0127464_0127758 BUT IT MIGHT MAKE MUCH MORE YOU KNOW I MEAN
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0128659_0128879 WELL I THINK WE SHOULD ASS I THINK WE SHOULD
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0129129_0130314 TRY TO FIND A THEORY THAT ALLOWS MULTIPLE SPEAKERS AND RELATIONS TO SPAN OVER MORE THAN ONE SPEA YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0130314_0131242 BECAUSE IT IS TRUE THAT I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE DAMSEL AND OTHER ATTEMPTS TO COME UP WITH ANNOTATION SCHEMES FOR FOR DIALOGUE ACTS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0131242_0131446 THERE WAS THIS NOTION OF FORWARD LOOKING AND BACKWARD LOOKING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0131446_0131572 ANYWAY THEY'RE RELATIONAL
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0131572_0131927 I MEAN IN SOME WAY YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL RELATIONAL
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0131927_0132152 UM BUT YOU NEEDED
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0132402_0133118 BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF TAGS IN THERE FROM THE KINDS OF RELATIONS YOU SEE WITHIN R. S. T. FOR EXAMPLE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0133118_0134016 SO IF YOU LOOK AT AMANDA STENT'S THESIS AND THE ANALYSIS THAT SHE DID SORT OF WITHIN A TURN SHE USED SOMETHING LIKE R. S. T.
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0134016_0134412 AND THEN ACROSS TURNS SHE USED DAMSEL RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0138918_0138986 WELL I
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0139959_0140219 WELL IT GIVES YOU THINGS LIKE ACCEPT AND REJECT AND
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0140387_0140482 OH YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0140816_0141036 IN FACT R. S. T. DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0141805_0141855 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0141979_0142068 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0142068_0142093 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0142971_0143179 RIGHT OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0143179_0144420 D SO I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE IMPOR I THINK IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO GO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FIGURING OUT WHAT KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS WE WANT AND THEN FINDING AND
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0144420_0145041 YOU KNOW LIKE SETTING DOWN WHAT THE CONSTRAINTS ARE ON THE ANALYSIS GAME
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0145041_0145346 HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE DATA OKAY S TO GOOD
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0145346_0145719 UM AND THEN AND THEN THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THEORIES OF ARGUMENT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0145719_0146793 I MEAN YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT THE SORT OF JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING KINDS OF UM APPROACHES
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0146793_0147592 SO YOU KNOW CLARK AND LOCKBAUM AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT KIND OF THING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0147592_0148256 THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR DIALOGUE RIGHT I MEAN AND CAN BE EXPANDED TO MORE THAN TWO PERSONS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0148256_0148478 ACTUALLY THE LOCKBAUM STUFF IS FOR GROUPS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0186037_0186458 YEAH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO KNOW WHAT M
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0187805_0187903 BUT WHO'S THEY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0187903_0187987 THAT'S THE QUESTION
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0188207_0188275 WHO
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0188460_0188508 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0201968_0201988 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0224454_0224990 WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT UM W IT I DON'T KNOW UH W IT'D PROBABLY GET TO RE HEAR YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0224990_0225707 MORE OF YOUR PRESENTATION BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT CANDIDATES AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T GO THROUGH AND MARK UP EVERY MEETING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0225707_0225982 I MEAN MARK UP MEETINGS WITH EVERY SCHEME WE THINK OF
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0225982_0226832 SO I THINK WE HAVE TO KIND OF GET AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE CANDIDATES ARE M IF THERE'S LIKE TWO OR THREE THAT WE THINK ARE GOOD CONTENDERS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0226832_0227046 THEN WE TRY TO SEE WHAT WORKS BETTER RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0229185_0229528 THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTION THERE ARE A LOT MORE OPTIONS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0229528_0229766 SO SO LET'S SEE WHAT WHAT ELSE YOU'VE GOT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0230602_0230781 OH SO THAT WAS IT ON DIALOGUE OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0231044_0231173 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0231173_0232283 SO UH IT'S VERY UNCLEAR TO ME WHY YOU THINK EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IS MORE PRINCIPAL T UH DID YOU I MEAN WHAT DID YOU HAVE SPECIFIC SCHEMES IN MIND THERE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0232283_0232475 OR SPEC MM SPECIFIC
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0232729_0233016 PEOPLE'S WORK THAT YOU UM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0238623_0239073 BUT CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF A SCHEME THAT'S BASED ON EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0239991_0240041 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0243030_0243098 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0247958_0248691 OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK THAT UM THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BEFORE I MEAN
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0248933_0248992 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0248992_0249110 I MEAN AND
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0252017_0252281 WELL WE'RE MARKING UP A LOT OF HIGHER LEVEL THINGS IN OUR
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0253065_0253090 OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0253090_0253535 SO UM HAVE YOU LOOKED AT NATE BLAYLOCK'S WORK
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0253967_0254746 SO HE HAS THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW ADOPT UM SO BASICALLY IT'S TO
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0254746_0255510 YOU KNOW COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING YOU KNOW MORE THAN ONE PERSON INVOLVED AND TRYING TO CHARACTERISE THINGS AS UM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0255798_0255942 YOU KNOW IF I
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0256146_0256486 I CAN'T REMEMBER THE I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ALL THE ACTIONS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0256798_0257428 NO SO SO THE COCONUT PROJECT IS A PROJECT THAT I DID WITH RICH THOMASSON AND BARBARA DIGINIO
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0257428_0257528 HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0257719_0257813 NOT VERY CLEAR
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0257813_0257909 NO
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0257909_0258081 THOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL IN THE PAPER
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0258081_0258375 BUT YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT NO IN VERY MUCH DETAIL
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0258375_0258566 OKAY SO I THINK YOU SHOULD
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0258566_0259542 UM BECAUSE IT WAS ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE DONE FOR JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING AND JOINT ACTION I THINK ARE VERY RELEVANT TO LOOK AT BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE SOLVING A PROBLEM TOGETHER
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0259542_0259631 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0259631_0260521 SO UM WHILE THESE SCHEMES MAY NOT HAVE THEY HAVE SOME ES OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS THAT YOU NEED TO CHARACTERISE UM JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0260521_0260728 SO WHILE TH UM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0260784_0261407 YOU MAY THINK THAT THEY'RE MISSING SOMETHING THEN WE WE COULD CERTAINLY AUGMENT THEM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0261407_0261573 BUT I THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0261573_0261940 AND SO SO NATE BLAYLOCK TRIED TO OKAY SO YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0261940_0262575 FROM GROSS AND KRAUSS AND GROSS AND SIDENER CAME ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT SHARED PLANS AND HOW YOU REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0262575_0262860 YOU KNOW DIALOGUE U UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND SHARED PLANS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0262860_0263633 BUT THE ACTUAL THEORETICAL UM OR FORMALISATION OF IT WAS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0263633_0264446 AND SO UM LOCKBAUM SIMPLIFIED IT QUITE AND YOU KNOW SIDENER AND RICH AND COLLAGEN HAVE SIMPLIFIED IT QUITE A BIT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0264446_0265302 UM BUT NATE BLAYLOCK TRIED TO UM YOU KNOW DEFINE

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0267012_0267859 UM WHICH WE TRIED TO APPLY TO TUTORING BUT IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL FOR TUTORING 'CAUSE TUTORING'S JUST A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BALL GAME
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0267859_0268174 BUT UM IT YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0268174_0269049 WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING AT IT AND IT DID STRIKE ME THAT FOR JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING THERE W THERE WERE SOME GOOD IDEAS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0269049_0269555 AND THERE IS YOU KNOW A SET OF TAGS AND WHAT THEY MEAN AND YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF THING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0269555_0269915 AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT YOU KNOW CL YOU KNOW CLARK ON JOINT ACTION

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0270193_0270308 BUT UM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0270477_0270869 BUT THE OVERARCHING IDEA YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0270869_0271480 I MEAN I THINK ACCOUNTS FOR A LOT OF THE WAYS IN WHICH UM YOU KNOW THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE THI ARE THINKING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0271480_0272287 BUT I MEAN I THINK THAT WE WE BASICALLY HAVE TO MERGE SOME OF THIS STUFF THAT'S BEEN DONE YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0272287_0273078 ON MEETINGS WITH SOME OF THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN DONE ON COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING 'CAUSE THERE'S ELEMENTS OF EACH THAT SEEM REALLY IMPORTANT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0273078_0273168 AND I THINK TH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0273981_0274603 BECAUSE IT REALLY SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT AND SOME OF THIS STUFF ON EXCHANGE IS LIKE ANCIENT AND YOU KNOW

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0275090_0275600 SO I MEAN ALL THE CONVERSATIONAL ANALYSIS STUFF I MEAN THOSE GUYS NEVER COUNT ANYTHING YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0275600_0276229 I MEAN THEY'RE UH PS SO THEY SEE A PATTERN AND THEN THEY THINK IT'S KINDA CUTE AND THEN THEY SCOUR THE WORLD FOR THIRD TURN REPAIRS YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0276229_0276534 THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SAY HOW OFTEN DO THOSE HAPPEN
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0276534_0276857 I MEAN THEY WORKED I MEAN I KNOW MANNY SCHEGLOFF REALLY WELL AND THEY'RE NOT COUNTERS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0276857_0276994 THEY'RE PURPOSELY NOT COUNTERS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0276994_0277276 THEY DEFINE THEMSELVES AS NON COUNTERS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0278589_0278715 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0278715_0278928 YEAH TH I MEAN IT IT DOES SEEM LIKE YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0278928_0279616 THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT FROM THAT AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT FROM COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0279616_0279669 AND
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0279833_0280146 IF YOU L IF YOU TAKE THE EXCHANGE STUFF IT'S NOT GONNA D QUITE DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0280146_0280497 AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING STUFF MAYBE IT WON'T DO EVERY THAT YOU WANT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0280497_0280564 AND SO
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0285652_0285688 HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0290882_0291935 LIKE SOMEBODY'S WRITING ON THE WHITE BOARD OR I MEAN THE W MEETING ACTIONS THEY PRESENTED AT THE REVIEW SEEMED REALLY LOW LEVEL TO ME LIKE SOMEBODY STOOD UP

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0295237_0295445 SO YEAH MM OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0322601_0322786 WELL I THINK WE SHOULD APPROACH IT BOTH WAYS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0322786_0322995 I MEAN UH YOU KNOW I I D
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0323295_0323590 YOU KNOW THE MEETING BROWSER PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF CONSTRAINTS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0323590_0324453 AND SO WHAT THEY END UP WITH SAYING IS MOST CRITICAL FOR THEM RIGHT NOW MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST INTERESTING THING IN THE LONGER TERM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0324453_0324545 AND SO
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0325020_0325067 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0325067_0325764 I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW A DECISION HAS EVOLVED RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0325764_0326053 UM AND I THINK THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0326237_0326666 WELL I DON'T KNOW IF ALL OF THIS LOW LEVEL STUFF WOULD ALLOW YOU TO TRACK THAT KIND OF THING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0326666_0327144 BUT IT MIGHT AT LEAST BE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ALLOWING YOU TO TRACK THAT KIND OF THING AND
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0327788_0327932 YEAH SOME HIGHER LEVEL YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0328319_0328897 SO I MEAN I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMETHING AT THIS LEVEL NEEDS TO BE THERE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0328897_0329439 I MEAN AND TO ASK QUESTIONS LIKE WHO DISAGREED OR WERE THERE ANY COUNTER PROPOSALS OR WHATEVER
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0329439_0329789 EVEN THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS YOU NEED SOME KIND OF MARK UP LIKE THIS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0332386_0332766 WELL THAT BRINGS UP SOMETHING INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK PROBABLY WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS TRY TO GET
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0333139_0333248 YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0333539_0333873 TASKS SORT OF PUT ON YOU KNOW SORT OF AS PART OF THE OFFICIAL AGENDA
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0333873_0334759 SO BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE UM WERE THERE ANY COUNTER PROPOSALS TO THE BANA YOU KNOW BANANA SHAPE OR WHATEVER
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0334759_0335296 UM UH OR TO SOME SPECIFIC YOU KNOW RECOMMENDATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0335869_0336506 PEOPLE WHO GO TO DECISION MAKING MEETINGS WANT TO KNOW IF THEY'VE MISSED ONE OR ARE ARRIVING LATE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0336506_0337083 SO IT WOU IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET SOME OF THESE THINGS ON THE OFFICIAL AGENDA AND SAY LOOK
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0337083_0337640 YOU KNOW WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF YOU COULD HAVE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0339302_0339628 AND I THINK WE WOULDN'T WANNA NECESSARILY DO THIS ON ICSI DATA
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0339628_0340418 I THINK THE ICSI DATA IS TOO TOO COMPLEX AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH REAL DECISIONS MADE YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD CLEARLY IDENTIFY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0340418_0340831 I MEAN THERE ARE SOME BUT AND NOT THAT I'VE READ MORE THAN ABOUT TWO MEETINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0340831_0341829 BUT UM I THINK W IT YOU KNOW W WELL SO ONE THING THAT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING IS THE I THINK TO ME
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0341829_0343188 IS THE UM WHAT CAN YOU DO BECAUSE PRESUMABLY THE UM D. F. K. I. FOLK OR SOMEBODY IS GONNA MARK UP A LOT OF THE DATA WITH SORT OF TAGS ABOUT ONTOLOGY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0343188_0343230 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0343262_0344084 SO WE KNOW YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WILL HAVE GONE AND BY HAND AND SORT OF MARKED UP SOM SOMETHING L LIKE SHALLOW SEMANTICY KINDS OF THINGS RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0344084_0344618 OR MAYBE DEEPER SEMANTICY THINGS BUT THAT BUT YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0344618_0345202 NOT REALLY IN A IN A FORMAL LANGUAGE BUT MOSTLY JUST YOU KNOW TAGS RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0345202_0345873 UM AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WELL HOW DOES YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0345873_0346270 JUST THE WAY PEOPLE TYPICALLY DO THIS IS YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0346270_0346809 LET'S TAKE THESE SEMANTIC FEATURES INTO OR THESE FEATURES INTO ACCOUNT AND SEE HOW WELL WE DO WITH THE THE LEARNING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0346809_0347382 AND THEN LET'S THROW THESE FEATURES OUT AND SEE HOW WELL WE DO UM BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE THEM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0347382_0347884 BECAUSE ONE OR TWO SIDES IS REALLY INTR ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS ONTOLOGY STUFF RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0347884_0348303 I MEAN T. N. O. IS AND D. F. K. I. IS RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0348360_0348847 SO THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF DOMAIN SEMANTICS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0348847_0351055 AND THERE WILL ALSO BE PRESUMABLY SOME KIND OF TASK HIERARCHY MODELLING GOING ON IN I MEAN 'CAUSE THE WHOLE BROWSER WORKING GROUP UM FINAL UM SORT OF PRESENTATION ON THAT SECOND DAY WAS ABOUT

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0352811_0353282 WHICH SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD IN AN OPEN DOMAIN
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0353797_0354225 YOU REMEMBER WHEN STEVE CAME IN STEVE WHITTAKER CAME IN AT THE END AND SAID YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0354225_0354734 THEY'D SPENT THE MORNING TALKING AND THEY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0361857_0362120 I MEAN IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE DOMAIN TASK
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0362306_0362584 AND IT IS REALLY THE IT AND GIVEN THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0362584_0363385 UH IT IT'S REALLY SCARY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO IN AN OPEN DOMAIN WHERE YOU DON'T WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TASKS ARE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0363385_0363872 AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO FIGURE THEM OUT UH VERY RELIABLY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0364533_0365203 I DO BUT THE WHOLE PROJECT IS YOU KNOW FOCUSSED ON AMI HUB DATA AS THEIR FIRST PRIORITY

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0370197_0371549 AND THEN THERE WAS THIS CONFUSION ABOUT THE UM LAST SPIDER PHONE CONFERENCE THAT THE MESSAGES TELLING PEOPLE TO CALL CAME OUT AFTER THE MEETING HAPPENED
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0371549_0371657 AT LEAST TO SOME OF US

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0375649_0376261 WELL I THINK WHEN HE DOES RE WHEN HE DOES LEAR THESE LEARNING EXPERIMENTS HE SHOULD DO 'EM TWO WAYS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0376261_0376522 BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH OR WITHOUT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0376522_0376986 AND THEN WE CAN SEE LIKE WELL WITHOUT YOU KNOW THESE TAGS SO YOU KNOW

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0381202_0381472 WELL WE WON'T I MEAN WE WON'T USE 'EM TILL THEY'RE READY OBVIOUSLY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0381472_0381814 SO WE MIGHT DO THE SORT OF OPEN DOMAIN
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0381814_0382345 I MEAN A ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE A CLOSED DOMAIN I MEAN WE WE CAN'T USE ANY DOMAIN INFORMATION NECESSARILY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0382345_0382399 UH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0382647_0383797 I MEAN THERE PROBABLY ARE A BUNCH OF ISSUES LIKE IF YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED HOURS OF MEETINGS AND THEY ALL TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0383797_0384849 THEN IT'S EA IT IT'S NOT REALLY OPEN DOMAIN AND SOMEHOW THAT SNEAKS INTO ALL THE STATISTICS ANYWAY 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE SUCH A WIDE VOCABULARY AND YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0385199_0385244 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0385557_0386215 SURE SO WE MIGHT FIND THAT WHEN WE MOVE FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS OPEN DOMAIN BUT ON THE HUB

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0390997_0391420 UM SO BEFORE WE DO THAT CAN I JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT CHUNKING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0391420_0392018 IN THE BEGINNING YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT YOU WERE DOING THIS CHUNKING UM AND YOU'RE DOING IT ON THE ICSI DATA
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0392018_0392529 BUT THIS WAS DID YOU SAY IT TH WASN'T PICKED UP IN AMI OR YOU I I I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT W

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0395702_0396036 SO THAT'S STILL ON THE AGENDA TO DO AT SOME POINT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0396353_0396396 YEAH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0396396_0396480 EXACTLY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0396480_0396515 THAT'S
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0396759_0397210 WELL SO I MEAN RIGHT

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0397679_0398297 I MEAN SO I MEAN WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW S CHUNKING INTERACTS WITH THE AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0398297_0398860 BECAUSE UM BARBARA WAS SHOWING THE LOW LEVEL
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0399319_0400065 AND I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CHUNKING SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF SO IF IF YOUR DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTER SAYS THERE'S THERE'S A SEGMENT HERE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0400065_0400171 BUT YOUR CHUNKER SAID NO
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0400171_0401076 THIS IS A COHERENT CHUNK THEN Y Y YOU KNOW W I MEAN MAYBE THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER TO DO A BETTER JOB THAN
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0401601_0401660 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0401660_0401689 YEAH

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0404499_0404703 RIGHT OKAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0404703_0404785 GOOD
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0404785_0405020 SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WELL W
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0406543_0406660 WELL HOW MUCH AMI
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0407244_0407613 WELL YOU WANTED TO DO THE CHUNKING ON THE AMI DATA RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0407613_0407757 BECAUSE M
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0408783_0409282 SO WE GOT STUCK AT SOME POINT ON EVALUATION OF CHUNKING RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0409282_0410013 THE PROBLEM WAS YOU DIDN'T HAVE ICSI DATA THAT WAS HAND LABELLED FOR CHUNKS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0410013_0410916 AND WE DECIDED LABELLING THE ICSI DATA FOR CHUNKS WOULD BE PROBABLY DIFFICULT AND MAYBE NOT VERY USEFUL
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0410916_0411037 AND SO IT IT MI
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0411452_0412176 OKAY IF THERE IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS HAND LABELLED DATA THAT YOU COULD EVALUATE AGAIN SO TRAIN ON SOME AND EVALUATE ON SOME
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0412176_0412651 WOULDN'T THAT UM 'CAUSE YOU'VE TRAINED ON SWITCHBOARD RIGHT WHERE THERE THERE ARE CHUNKS
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0412651_0413331 SO IF YOU HAD SOME ICSI DATA THAT YOU COULD MAYBE USE I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0413331_0413918 UM AS A WHAT'S THE N THERE'S T THERE'S A TRAINING SET AND THEN THERE'S THE DEVELOPMENT SET AND THEN THERE'S THE TEST SET
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0413918_0414593 MAYBE YOU'D USE SOME CHUNKED ICSI STUFF AS DEVELOPMENT OR SOMETHING AND DO SOME LAST TWEAKS AND THEN EVALUATE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0414593_0415197 BUT YOU KNOW W H I MEAN I CAN SEE WHY WEI XUN DIDN'T WANNA SPEND HIS TIME CHUNKING ICSI D
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0416506_0417010 WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO GET SOME PORTION OF THE DATA HAND CHUNKED
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0417860_0418092 HOW MUCH UM WELL
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0418249_0418337 HOW MUCH
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0418493_0418680 IN SWITCHBOARD
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0418680_0418882 SWITCHBOARD IS ALL CHUNKED
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0418882_0418908 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0419552_0419588 RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0419825_0419875 WELL
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0420576_0420858 NO YOU HAD PENN TREE BANK PARSES AND YOU MADE CHUNKS FROM THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0422107_0422139 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0423552_0423708 IS ANYBODY GONNA PARSE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0423708_0423979 IS ANY GONNA TRY TO ANYBODY TRY TO PARSE THE AMI DATA
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0429504_0429714 WELL THEY'RE USING THE E. R. G. RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0429714_0430735 THE WHICH PROBABLY HAS A L MAYBE FINER G UH WHICH I BELIEVE HAS FINER GRAINED DISTINCTIONS THAN AND DIFFERENT LABELS THAN THE PENN TREE BANK
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0431172_0431834 IT'S I'M T IT'S PROBABLY EASY TO DUMB DOWN THE H. P. S. G. PARSE TOO
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0431834_0432472 'CAUSE THE PENN TREE BANK PARSERS ARE PRETTY MINIMAL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANNA COMMIT TO A SPECIFIC GRAMMATICAL THEORY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0432472_0432880 SO I MEAN IT PROBABLY IS WORTH LOOKING AT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0433029_0433293 'CAUSE THEY'RE DOING THIS WITH DAN FLICKINGER RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0433293_0434399 WHICH IS THE SAME UM PARSER AS THE REDWOODS TREE BANK WAS MADE WITH THAT ALEX TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0434399_0434609 SO YOU CAN LOOK AT REDWOODS PARSES
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0434813_0435334 UM AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE FROM TREE BANK PARSES
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0435334_0436220 AND YOU MIGHT WANNA TALK TO ALEX TO FIND OUT IF SOMEBODY'S ALREADY DONE THIS TURN REDWOODS STUFF INTO TREE BANK STUFF SO THAT THEY CAN COMPARE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0436220_0436537 YOU KNOW AGAINST RESULTS THAT ARE REPORTED ON TREE BANK
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0436821_0437108 WELL THAT WAS THE IDEA I BELIEVE BUT UM
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0437447_0437772 IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ANOTHER TREE BANK
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0439675_0440568 WELL THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THEN YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH AND PARSE YOU'LL BE GETTING THE SAME CHUNKS AS WHEN YOU DO THIS PROCESS AUTOMATICALLY
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0440568_0441331 'CAUSE THE PROBLEM W WHEN YOU GO THROUGH AND HAND DO IT IS THEN SUDDENLY YOU INTRODUCE YOUR AUTOMATIC METHOD AND YOUR ACCURACY GOES CAN GO WAY DOWN
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0441331_0441727 I MEAN SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T IF YOU KNOW SORT OF FOR PART OF SPEECH TAGGING YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0441727_0442083 WHETHER YOU DO IT BY HAND OR MACHINE IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ACCURACY RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0442083_0442110 BUT

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0451616_0452172 SO WE HAVE ALL THAT STUFF HERE YOU KNOW THE PARSED VERBMOBIL MATERIAL
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0452172_0452675 SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SEE WHAT THE PARSE TREES LOOK LIKE
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0452675_0453018 YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR D. F. K. I.
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0453018_0453935 AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU THINK OH THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAP THESE INTO PENN TREE BANK STYLE BRACKETING
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0453935_0454360 THEN THEN WE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0454560_0454703 BUT I THINK THEY HAD THAT IN MIND
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0454703_0455022 SO IT'S IT'S WORTH ALSO TALKING TO HER ABOUT THAT
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0455022_0455103 OKAY GOOD
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0458053_0458391 EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAYS THERE'S NO DATA LIKE MORE DATA
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0459060_0459918 YOU KNOW I MEAN THE TYPICAL THING IS TO DO LEAVE ONE OUT CROSS VALIDATION WITH YOU KNOW EIGHTY NINE DIALOGUES
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0459918_0461006 OKAY SO I TRAINED ON EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN OR I TRAIN ON ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE AND OKAY BUT WE SHOULD SPEAK TO STEVE

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0461345_0461756 WELL THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT IS CHUNKING GONNA HELP
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0461756_0462285 I MEAN I THINK CHUNKING COULD HELP AUTOMATIC DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTATION
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0462285_0462642 I THINK CHUNKING COULD HELP AS YOU MENTIONED NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0462642_0462704 UM

AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0504395_0505009 MAYBE IF IT WOULD NEED SOME HIGHER LEVEL ANALYSIS BEFORE IT COULD BE DIRECTLY USED FOR THAT PURPOSE WE SHOULD STILL KEEP THAT IN MIND
AMI_EN2005a_H03_FEE085_0505009_0506828 AND SO I THINK GOING THROUGH THE PRESENTATIONS THAT UM WERE GIVEN AT THE WORK PACKAGE SIX MEETING WHERE UM AND I THINK IT WAS UM IT WASN'T WHA WAS IT ANITA OR WAS IT OH I'VE FORGOTTEN HER NAME

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0140592_0140971 OKAY SO TH LYMAN ALPHA FOREST AGAIN
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0141244_0141677 AND THAT DEFINITELY IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE ON ITS OWN THEN 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T EVEN SAY LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0141824_0142352 EACH HELIUM TWO OPTICAL DEPTH I THINK THAT'S ELEMENTAL SPECIES
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0142930_0142943 OH
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0142943_0143163 OH WE MARKED THE SAME LINES

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0143893_0144021 'CAUSE THE PROPERTY OF THE LINE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0144021_0144234 THEY'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF THESE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0144234_0144536 AND WE WEREN'T USING LINE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0144666_0144898 WHAT WAS THE ONE WE DIDN'T DO BEFORE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0144898_0145027 LINE RATIO WE WEREN'T DOING
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0145768_0145993 WAS TALKING ABOUT L LINES OKAY
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0146663_0146805 LINE FEATURE NEED THAT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0147948_0148058 THERE'S ONLY ONE DIFFERENCE HERE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0148569_0148898 NO NO THEY ARE THE SAME OTHERWISE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0148898_0149249 QUITE IMPRESSIVELY
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0149249_0149345 THAT ONE'S THE SAME
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0150123_0150389 AND DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA DATA
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0150720_0151028 I CAN'T EVEN BUT IF YOU SAID
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0151259_0151385 IF YOU SAID THE SPECTRAL DAT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0151502_0151694 THE CONTINUUM'S SPET MM
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0152004_0152411 BUT IF IT'S A DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SPECTRUM YOU'D MARK DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA BECAUSE IN THE SPECTRUM
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0152411_0152593 AND AND A DA IS EQUIVALENT OF SPECTRUM
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0153951_0154267 THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS TALKING ABOUT S BUT IF IT'S SAYING SILICONE TWO LINE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0154434_0154556 LEVELS THE NEW WORD
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0155421_0155637 I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT IN THE CASE OF IT BEING DATA
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0156827_0156863 MM
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0157506_0157560 WELL
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0157892_0158060 IF IT'S AN EMISSION LINE DATA
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0158279_0158389 MM
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0158389_0158588 IF IT'S AN EMISSION LINE DATA WOULD WE PUT IT IN
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0158736_0159051 BUT IF IT JUST SAID EM BUT IF IT JUST SAID EMISSION LINE WE WOULD
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0159253_0159368 IT THE EMISSION LINE IS STRONG
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0159368_0159539 THE EMISSION LINE DATA SHOWS STRONG
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0159906_0160431 THEN UH I THINK IT'S THE SAME ACTUALLY I TH I THINK IT'S DATA ISN'T EVEN NEEDED
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0160687_0161140 IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA AT MORE THAN THE NINETY NINE PERCENT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0161140_0161637 OR THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA FEATURE IF YOU PUT FEATURE THERE RATHER THAN DATA THEN YOU'D MARK IT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0161637_0161798 BUT I THINK DATA IS EQUIVALENT IF
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0163565_0163591 YEAH
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0166640_0166742 OKAY
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0166742_0166827 THAT'S THINK ENOUGH
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0167084_0167460 GIVEN THAT WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT IT FOR TEN MINUTES IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT CLEAR CUT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0167649_0167981 DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SYSTEMS AND UH IT SHOULDN'T BE EITHER OF THEM
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0167981_0168187 IT SHOULD BE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0168316_0168470 IN RED WHATEVER THAT IS
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0168470_0168564 SPECTRAL FEATURE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0168968_0169137 AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE AT ALL
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0169347_0169444 AND I'VE DONE IT TWICE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0170184_0170299 IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0171003_0171097 FLAT SPECTRUM
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0171230_0172139 WE WERE INCLUDING MODIFIERS INCLUDING BROAD LINE QUASARS NON BROAD LINE QUASARS AS WELL
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0172139_0172715 SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY INCLUDE THE FLAT SPECTRUM WITH YOUR Q WITH YOUR QUASAR IS A VERY DIFFERENT FROM STEEP SPECTRUM
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0173346_0173471 WE'RE TEN PERCENT OF THE WAY THERE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0173924_0174005 CONTINUA

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0177342_0177864 HEAVY ELEMENT ABSORPTION LINES I THINK SHOULD BE THERE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0178281_0178408 NOW WHAT ELSE IS DIFFERENT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0179008_0179045 MM

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0179917_0180284 YOU'RE RIGHT STAR FORMING GALAXIES ARE DISTINCT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0180835_0181239 THAT'S YEAH DERIVED
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0181239_0181485 PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU WERE DOING SEVEN THOUSAND OF THESE AN HOUR

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0183901_0184064 BLUE WING FLUX
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0184064_0184185 WHAT WERE WE GONNA DO ABOUT FLUX
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0185639_0185686 DOESN'T SAY
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0186658_0186872 YES IT'S THE AMOUNT OF STUFF IN THE BLUE WING
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0186872_0186994 SO I'M HAPPY WITH THAT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0187353_0187455 LINE PEAK
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0188079_0188272 I THINK THAT SHOULD BE MARKED
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0188272_0188686 EVEN THOUGH IT'S TALKING ABOUT INCREASING LINE PEAK IT'S ALSO TALKING ABOUT INCREASING EXCESS BLUE WING
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0189089_0189246 SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EXCESS BLUE WING FLUX
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0189916_0189951 ANYWAY
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0190244_0190457 I THINK LINE PEAK IS SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT TO
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0190854_0191284 NO BUT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T S ALSO POINT TO INCREA INCREASING BLUE WING
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0191375_0191391 WHAT

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0194611_0194791 RIGHT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0194791_0195026 NEUTRAL HYDROGEN GUNN PETERSEN ABSORPTION
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0195344_0195477 I THINK ALL OF THAT'S A SPECTRAL
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0195591_0195646 FEATURE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0195890_0196369 IT'S BASICALLY A WAY OF SAYING THE GUNN PETERSEN T IT'S A WAY OF SAYING THE GUNN PETERSEN TROUGH THOUGH
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0196503_0197414 WHICH IF YOU JUST SAID THAT IT'S GUNN PETERSEN ABSORPTION FROM NEUTRAL HYDROGEN RATHER THAN I IF IT WAS A T IF IT WAS HYDROGEN ABSORPTION
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0197414_0197502 YOU'D MARK THE WHOLE THING
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0197502_0198146 IF IT WAS HYDROGEN ALIGN YOU WOULD SO YOU SHOULD MARK IF IT WAS OR H. BETA ABSORPTION
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0198146_0198420 IT'S A MARKS THE KIND OF SPECTRAL FEATURE DOESN'T IT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0198706_0199070 BUT SO IS H. BETA ABSORP UH EMISSION AS A PROCESS FROM H. BETA
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0199070_0199352 BUT IT'S STILL THIS IS A PROCESS FROM NEUTRAL HYDROGEN
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0199514_0199760 I GUESS WHAT I'M MEANING IS NEUTRAL HYDROGEN SHOULD BE IN THERE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0199760_0199935 AND THE FACT THAT GUNN PETERSON COMES BETWEEN IT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0200069_0200141 IS JUST A PAIN

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0204173_0204328 BLUE SHIFTED ABSORPTION
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0205088_0205460 I THINK IT'S A MODIFIER OF THE THING AND SO IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE THERE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0205973_0206423 AS IN WE'RE PUTTING WEAK AND STRONG ABSORPTION WOULD COUNT SO I THINK BLUE SHIFTED SHOULD
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0206423_0206505 UM
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0206664_0206860 THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE LINE ISN'T IT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0207191_0207328 SO THAT SHOULD BE IN
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0207936_0208179 YEAH
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0208179_0208256 THAT'S TALKING ABOUT UH
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0208576_0208854 STRENGTH RATHER THAN
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0209014_0209467 IT'S NOT THE UH ABUNDANCE OF IT OR ANY DERIVED PROPERTY IT'S JUST THE STRENGTH OF THE LINES
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0210530_0210652 I GUESS PERHAPS IT IS
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0210817_0211159 UM LET'S MAKE A DECISION
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0211919_0212084 I GUESS IT COULD BE ABUNDANCE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0212739_0212816 YES THAT'S TRUE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0212816_0213214 I THINK YOU PROBABLY SHOULD THEN 'CAUSE WE WILL PUT IN OUR ALIGN STRENGTH
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0213214_0213680 UH IF IT'S A F. I OF A TWO LINE STRENGTH WE WOULD DEFINITELY PUT IT IN
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0213888_0214155 AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S REFERRING TO EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0218375_0218588 BUT IT'S A STRENGTH RATHER THAN ABUNDANCE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0218588_0219094 I THINK THAT'S STILL LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT OF FLUX COMING OUT OF THE OUT OF ALL THE F. E. TWO LINES RATHER THAN
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0220112_0220864 IN GENERAL WE HAVEN'T IF UNLESS IT'S SPECIFICALLY SAYING IT'S A LINE BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS JUST AS SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO A LINE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0220864_0221084 AND I MAYBE IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH TO MARK
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0221325_0221431 LET'S NOT MARK IT THEN

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0221815_0222385 IF IT SAYS IT F. E. TWO LINE STRENGTH THEN WE WOULD MARK IT 'CAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LINE OF IT RATHER THAN THE EV ELEMENT
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0223166_0223286 THE WORD LINE SHOULD BE IN THERE
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0223286_0223327 OR

AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0224521_0224621 I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY PROBABLY MEAN
AMI_EN2006a_H01_FEE087_0224621_0224880 BUT IT'S JUST NOT VERY CLEAR

AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0186978_0187151 YEAH YOU'D BE SURPRI THESE THINGS DO
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0187437_0187777 WELL IF THEY WERE GONNA DO THAT THEN THEY'D FORCE YOU TO GO TO IT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0187777_0188023 I WOULD AND I WOULD KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'D GONE TO KNOW
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0188023_0188202 YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0188202_0188385 I'M PRETTY SURE THEY DIDN'T HAVE INDUCTION IN MY DAY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0188385_0188425 SO
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0188706_0188787 REALLY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0188787_0188899 BUT YOU ONLY STARTED HERE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0189185_0189307 THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO I'M SURE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0190369_0190403 OH WELL
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0191907_0191958 OH YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0191958_0191997 UH

AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0193355_0193384 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0193803_0193839 OKAY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0195735_0195768 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0196050_0196121 SEEMS REASONABLE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0196294_0196754 SO UM IT'LL BE LIKE IN UH MONITOR
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0196754_0197098 BUT YEAH THEY'LL ALL BE DIFFERENT TIERS LIKE THAT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0197098_0197349 AND THEN THERE'S THE LANGUAGE STUFF AS WELL PRESUMABLY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0197504_0197689 YEAH THIS IS THE EASY STUFF
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0197689_0197778 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0197778_0197913 WELL EYES AND MOUSE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0197913_0197996 EYES AND MICE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0198170_0198199 UH-HUH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0198396_0198518 AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR YOU RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0198518_0198804 I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE WAY YOU WANT IT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0198804_0198972 COURSE THERE ARE LOT LOTS OF THINGS THAT CAN DO THAT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0198972_0199272 BUT IT'S THE LANGUAGE PART THAT'S THE HARD PART
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0199272_0199307 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0199810_0199901 YEAH THAT'S
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0200143_0200301 THAT SEEMS FINE YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0200301_0200607 DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE UM THE SETS OF CODES ARE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0200607_0201075 WELL THE WHATEV WHATEVER WHATEVER YOU'RE GETTING OUT OF THE JAST ANALYSER
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0201075_0201123 SO
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0201401_0201680 I MEAN BLINKS AS WELL RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0202225_0202418 OH SO YOU DON'T WANT A PA UH PART OF THIS DATA
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0202700_0202799 AYE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0202799_0202827 BUT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0202970_0203401 I THINK YOU I THINK YOU SHOULD WELL THERE'S TWO VIEWS ON THIS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0203401_0203890 UM IF YOU DO THEN THE PEOPLE FORMULATING RESEARCH QUESTIONS WILL ASK ABOUT THEM
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0203890_0204258 BUT IF YOU DON'T THEY'LL PROBABLY ASK ABOUT THEM ANYWAY AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO ADD 'EM AFTER THE FACT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0204258_0204492 UH SO IT'S PROBABLY EASIER JUST TO S SHOVE 'EM IN
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0204492_0205186 YOU CAN STICK 'EM IN A DIFFERENT UM TRACK AND UH AND THEN LOAD 'EM OR NOT LOAD 'EM AS YOU PLEASE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0205186_0205346 'CAUSE IT'S NOT WELL I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0205346_0206058 WITH IS IT IS IT PART OF SO TH THESE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE SETS OF CODES AGAINST TIME RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0206058_0206200 ISN'T BLINK A PART OF THIS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0207096_0207142 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0207142_0207254 BUT BUT ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0207254_0207644 BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE BLINKING BASICALLY IT'S LIKE AN A NIL CODE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0207644_0207912 YOU C CAN'T FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING OTHERWISE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0207912_0208766 SO IT MAY ACTUALLY BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE BLINKS REGISTERED IN THERE BECAUSE YOU MAY DISCOVER YOU NEED TO TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT TO SMOOTH SOME KIND OF ANALYSIS THAT YOU'RE DOING
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0208766_0209264 SO IT COULD BE THAT IF THEY ONLY THEY HADN'T HAD A BLINK JUST THEN THEY WOULD'VE BEEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0210267_0210360 I'M THINKING MORE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0210638_0211013 THAT YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0211013_0211477 OH I HOPE N NOT TO MUCH RELIES ON MISSING STUFF 'CAUSE PEOPLE BLINK
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0211477_0211675 I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE UM YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0211675_0212346 THE PERSON LOOKS A P A PART AND THEY'VE GOT A UH FIXATION BEFORE AND AFTER AND THERE'S BLINK IN THE MIDDLE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0212346_0212825 AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE TIMES WHEN YOU WANNA TREAT THAT AS ONE THING RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0213692_0213736 OH RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0213736_0213835 OKAY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0213835_0214029 SO BUT IN THAT CASE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0214646_0214759 RIGHT UH-HUH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0214759_0215421 IN THAT CASE THEN UM THESE TIERS ARE ALREADY LIKE BLINK CORRECTED
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0215421_0215660 AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BLINKS AS PART OF THIS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0215660_0215852 YOU'D WANT BLINKS AS A SEPARATE TIER IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IT IN
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0216362_0216486 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0216486_0216898 YEAH SO THE KEY THING IS HE HERE IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0216898_0217839 AND UM THE SECOND KEY THING IS UM IT BETTER BE REALLY CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THESE CODES UM UH W YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0217839_0218329 WHETHER ANY MONKEY BUSINESS HAS BEEN DONE AROUND THE BLINKS TO CORRECT FOR THAT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0218329_0218909 UM 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE OBVIOUS LOOKING AT THAT SET OF CODES THAT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0219204_0219483 UH YEAH I SUPPOSE IF YOU KNOW ABOUT EYE TRACKERS THEN YOU'LL JUST KNOW
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0219483_0219673 BUT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0220321_0220608 IT I THINK YOU'RE JUST SAYING IT COMES OUT OF THE EYE TRACKER ALREADY RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0220608_0220723 THEY'RE ALREADY BLINK CORRECTED
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0225207_0225248 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0227305_0227369 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0227369_0228469 BUT WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IS LIKE AT WHAT STAGE IN THE EYE TRACKING STUFF WHERE IT DOES THAT AND WHETHER THAT GETS THROUGH SO THAT UM CRAIG GETS IT AUTOMATICALLY IN WHAT HE'S TRANSLATING OR TO G. D. F.
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0228469_0229138 WHETHER HE NEEDS TO REDO THE SAME ANALYSIS BECAUSE SOMETHING ABOUT THE DATA PATH CUTS OFF THAT ANALYSIS FOR THE EYE TRACKER
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0229138_0229523 OR WHETHER WE EVEN LIKE IT RIGHT AND WANNA DO IT SOME DIFFERENT WAY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0230489_0230573 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0230573_0231186 BUT IT COULD BE THESE THINGS ARE CORRECTED FOR BLINKS IN THIS WAY PLUS THERE'S BLINK INFORMATION
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0231186_0231746 SO YOU KNOW IT IT TREATS IT AS A FIXATION AROUND BLINKS AND IT ALSO JUST HAPPENS TO TELL YOU WHERE THE BLINKS ARE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0231746_0232242 'CAUSE AS THEY WERE SAYING THEY LIKE TO USE BLINK RATE AS MEASURES OF COGNITIVE DIFFICULTY OR SOMETHING
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0232242_0232291 SO
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0235342_0235760 IF THEY'RE NOT STILL FIXATING ON IT WHEN THEY COME BACK OUT OF THE BLINK THEN
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0235916_0236146 WHY IS THAT IS THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO ANALYTICALLY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0237146_0237188 OH RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0237188_0237264 YEAH YOU SAID THAT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0238415_0238698 WELL BUT DOES UM THE DURATION OF FIXATIONS COUNT FOR ANYTHING
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0238698_0239069 'CAUSE IT IF YOU'RE JUST ADDING THE LENGTH OF THE BLINK TO THE FIXATION YOU'RE NOT TREATING IT AS A SACCADE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0240153_0240200 OKAY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0240621_0240652 WAIT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0241707_0241880 OKAY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0241880_0241989 I KINDA GET THIS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0241989_0242052 YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0242052_0242077 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0242490_0242689 SO MORE COMPLICATED THAN I THOUGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0242689_0242944 I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE MULTIPLE FIXATIONS ON AN OBJECT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0242944_0243116 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0243116_0243142 OKAY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0246626_0247265 WELL IT'S NOT OKAY I MEAN THIS IS KINDA WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THIS CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE G. D. F.
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0247265_0247900 I MEAN YOU MIGHT SEE IT AS THE INITIAL G. D. F. IS JUST WHATEVER STRAIGHT FORWARDLY TRANSLATES WITHOUT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0247900_0248392 YOU KNOW WITHOUT TRANSFORMS WITH JUST THE DATA FORMAT CHANGING FROM THE ASCII
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0248392_0249187 AND THEN THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT GET ADDED THAT YOU MIGHT STILL WANT TO BE IN UM AUGMENTED G. D. F. FORMAT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0249187_0249479 YOU KNOW LIKE THIS BLINK AND THE GAZE AND WHATEVER ELSE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0249479_0249717 AND THEN YOU TRANSLATE TO N. X. T.
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0249717_0250171 SO YOU MIGHT STILL WANNA HAVE EVERYTHING IN THIS ONE G. D. F. FILE FORMAT THAT REPRESENTS EVERYTHING
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0250171_0250367 AND THEN THE N. X. T. THING IS JUST A SPLITTER
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0250367_0250581 IT'S NOT DOING ANY FANCY ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0250581_0250680 SO I SEE THIS AS YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0250680_0251898 A BUNCH OF LITTLE ROUTINES THAT TAKE THE THE G. D. F. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION IN IT AND ADD NEW INFORMATION INTO TH SUB SCRIPT VERSIONS OF THE G. D. F. FILE THAT CONTAINS THESE POST PROCESS ANALYSES
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0252961_0253030 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0255039_0255087 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0257359_0257398 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0257398_0257831 I MEAN IT TO SOME EXTENT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH DATA FORMAT IT'S IN N. X. T. OR G. D. F.
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0257831_0258376 BUT IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR THE CONVERTER BETWEEN G. D. F. AND N. X. T. NOT TO ADD ANY DATA
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0258376_0258806 ALL IT DOES IS DO THIS THIS STUPID DATA FORMAT CONVERSION
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0258806_0259112 AND IT IT'S JUST YOU KNOW SEPARATING IT OUT IN THE LITTLE STEPS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0259112_0259996 SO YOU KNOW THERE HAVE TO BE THESE OTHER SCRIPTS THAT ADD ANY UM DATA TRANSFORMS UM NOT DATA FORMAT TRANSFORM FORMS BUT DATA TRANSFORMS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0259996_0260589 LIKE THIS IDEA OF UM OF PUTTING TOGETHER GAZES FROM FIXATIONS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0260589_0261032 SO Y YOU KNOW I IF WE KEEP IT SIMPLER LIKE THAT SO THAT IT'S IN LITTLE PIECES
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0261032_0261487 THEN IT'LL BE JUST EASIER TO UNDERSTAND W WHAT THE WH THE WHOLE THING DOES
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0261619_0262030 'CAUSE YOU YOU C YOU KNOW I IF SUDDENLY YOU DISCOVER THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE G. D. F. TO N. X. T. TRANSFORM
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0262030_0262993 YOU WANNA KNOW WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THESE LITTLE POST PROCESSES GOING WRONG OR WHETHER IT'S JUST THE THING THAT DUMPS IT INTO THE MULTIPLE FILES FOR THE AND G. D. F. TO N. X. T. TRANSFORM IS C IS PRETTY SIMPLE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0262993_0263236 SO UM YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0265421_0265468 OH YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0268372_0268782 SO THAT'S LIKE ALL THE ANALYSIS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO THINGS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0268782_0268899 ARE YOU JUST GONNA COPY WHAT THEY DO
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0268899_0269249 OR IS IT DOCUMENTED LIKE WHY THEY DID IT THEY WAY THEY DID IT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0269249_0269337 OR IS IT JUST
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0270038_0270185 WELL IT'S GOOD STARTING POINT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0270185_0270559 SO IT'D BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF YOU AGREE WITH THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE ABOUT HOW TO DO THINGS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0272245_0272271 MM
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0274952_0274987 AH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0275467_0275730 WELL B BUT WE DON'T WANNA BUILD IT INTO OUR DATA PATH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0275730_0275971 WE JUST WANNA LEARN FROM IT I THINK RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0275971_0276070 CORRECT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0276070_0276109 OR NO
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0277146_0277232 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0277232_0277767 I'M JUST THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE I SO THIS TAKES THE ASCII TO TO A D SIMPLIFIED ASCII
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0277767_0279124 AND SIMPLIFIED IN WITH TRANSFORMS IN IT ASCII AND IT'S JUST IT SEEMS TO BE HARDER TO MAINTAIN SOMETHING THAT'S GOT THAT IN IT IF IT'D BE BETTER TO BREAK THINGS UP INTO LIKE STEPS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0279124_0279658 THAT YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE THE AND ALS WELL WHY DO I THINK THIS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0279658_0280216 I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROGRAMME AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA GIVE US THE NEXT VERSION AND THAT'S GONNA BREAK OUR ENTIRE PIPELINE
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0280216_0280335 YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0280335_0280407 THAT'S THE MAIN REASON
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0281593_0281694 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0281694_0282294 UH YEAH I CAN IMAGINE I CAN IMAGINE THAT ALSO REQUIRING SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER WHAT THEY DO IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANNA DO
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0282294_0282473 THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0282473_0282497 UH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0282910_0282947 UH-HUH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0283109_0283179 WELL SOUNDS GOOD
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0284278_0284318 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0284522_0284857 AND IF IN DOUBT UM DON'T FILTER STUFF OUT KEEP IT IN RIGHT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0284857_0285356 'CAUSE WE ALWAYS DUMP IT TO THIS OTHER N. X. T. TRACK THAT WE DON'T NEED TO LOAD NECESSARILY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0285356_0285755 SO UM THE IDEA IS YOU JUST KEEP STUFF UNLESS
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0286565_0286599 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0286996_0287367 OH YEAH AND IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO DUMP STUFF INTO AN INTO SEPARATE TRACK
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0287367_0287567 W WE GOTTA TEACH YOU ABOUT THIS AT SOME POINT THOUGH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0287567_0287777 SO UM BUT STILL NOT QUITE SURE WHEN
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0287777_0288092 IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE IN ANOTHER WEEK
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0288092_0289018 SO JONATHAN MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO UM TELL YOU ABOUT IT WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVED 'CAUSE YOU WERE GONNA GET OVERLOAD ABOUT LEARNING EYE TRACKERS AND NO
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0289018_0289384 IT'S JUST TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE AND IT WASN'T IMPORTANT THAT IT BE THEN
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0289804_0289849 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0289849_0289896 SO
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0290248_0290352 YEAH
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0290352_0290455 HE'S A COOL CUSTOMER
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0290455_0290820 HE'S READY FOR IT
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0290820_0290936 OKAY
AMI_EN2009c_H01_FEE083_0290936_0291023 I THINK WE'RE DONE RIGHT

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0001034_0002079 THERE ISN'T TH SO THERE ARE THINGS IN THE EYE TRACKER RECORD THAT WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT IN THE G. D. F. FORMAT UM LIKE THE FRAME RATE EYE MOVEMENT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0002079_0003090 YOU KNOW WE WE UH UH I WE'RE IF WE'RE EXPECTING THE G. D. F. FORMAT TO BE UM SORT OF A PARSED VERSION OF EVENTS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0003090_0003590 AND YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH RAW FRAME F FRAME RATE STUFF COMING OUT OF THIS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0003590_0004036 YOU WOULDN'T PROB YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT IN THIS KIND OF FORMAT FOR UP TRANSLATION TO THE OTHER THINGS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0004036_0004252 YEAH WE YEAH YOU CAN GET BACK TO IT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0004252_0004383 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0004383_0004474 WE'RE NOT THROWING ANYTHING AWAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0004474_0004579 THIS IS JUST THE STUFF

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0005288_0005361 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0005361_0006112 BUT THE TH BUT THE WAY TO THINK OF THIS IS THIS IS THE DATA THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ANALYSE AGAINST THE OTHER TRACKS OF DATA
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0006112_0006593 SO THE DATA THAT WE WANNA COMPARE WITH A LANGUAGE OR WITH WHATEVER
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0006593_0006777 AND UM SO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0008240_0008311 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0008311_0008553 S SO IN ESSENCE WHAT YOU WOULD THEN DO IS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0009567_0010003 WELL WE'RE NOT DOING FRAME RATE AT ANY FRAME FOR WELL MAYBE WE ARE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0010003_0010051 I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0010051_0010332 I I HAD THOUGHT WE WERE YEAH THE EYE TRACKER DOES
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0010332_0010371 BUT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0010511_0010568 BUT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0010568_0012030 W WHAT W UM THE KINDS OF EVENTS THAT WE HAD R UH BEFORE TALKED ABOUT PUTTING INTO THE RECORD FOR THEN USE IN ELAN AND N. X. T. ISN'T BASED ON SAYING EVERY X. SECONDS SOMETHING
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0012030_0012251 YOU KNOW GIVE ME GIVE ME WHAT'S HAPPENING EVERY X. SECONDS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0012251_0012816 IT'S MORE LIKE YOU KNOW GIVE ME THE FIXATIONS AND THE UM THE BLINKS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0012816_0012838 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0012838_0012861 OH YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0012861_0012940 DURATIONS ARE IN THERE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0012940_0013547 BUT IT'S NOT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UM SAYING THAT SOMETHING IS IN A PARTICULAR STATE EVERY FRAME
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0013547_0013818 WHATEVER THE FRAME RATE IS YOU KNOW TEN SECONDS A MINUTE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0013818_0014128 YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S ONE KIND OF W WAY OF LOOKING AT DATA
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0014128_0014721 AND UM A PARSED VERSION OF THE DATA WHICH ISN'T AT UM ANY PARTICULAR LENGTH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0014721_0014966 IT RELIES ON THIS REALLY CLOSE FRAME RATE THAT'S UNDERNEATH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0015576_0015608 NO NO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0015608_0015741 THE TIME THE TIME IS STILL IN THERE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0015741_0016383 BUT YOU'LL GET UH WHAT YOU WANT IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE UM THE CONCEPTS BEHIND THAT DATA THAT YOU WANT REPRESENTED
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0016383_0016768 SO RATHER THAN SAYING THE EYE WAS AT THIS PARTICULAR PLACE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0016768_0017218 YOU KNOW HERE AND THEN A TENTH OF A SECOND LATER HERE AND THEN A TENTH OF A SECOND LATER HERE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0017218_0017656 YOU SAY THERE WAS A FIXATION FROM THIS TIME TO THAT TIME AND THERE WAS BLINK FROM THIS TIME TO THAT TIME
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0017656_0017678 AND
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0019185_0019222 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0020743_0020779 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0022163_0022200 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0022200_0022286 SO THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0022286_0022427 WE'RE NOT THROWING ANYTHING AWAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0022427_0022855 BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT TOOL WOULD YOU USE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE DATA
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0022855_0023195 WOULD YOU BE SO THE MORE YOU CAN PLAN
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0023390_0023426 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0024829_0024859 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0026293_0026322 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0026514_0026908 SO YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME IT WAS ON DURING THAT FIXATION
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0027014_0027039 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0028769_0029124 OKAY SO THE PERCENTAGE IS I I IS A CUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE USING FOR MEASUREMENT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0029124_0029355 IT'S A CUT OFF FOR WHETHER OR NOT IT COUNTS AS A FIXATION
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0029355_0029398 IS THAT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0031899_0031930 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0032951_0032976 MM-HMM

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0036530_0036554 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0037963_0037995 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0038197_0038553 'CAUSE ALL YOU WANNA KNOW IS WHETHER THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE SAME OBJECT IN THE PERIOD AFTER
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0039110_0039142 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0039380_0039433 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0039433_0039883 CAN WE DRAW IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT UM THAT THIS IS SATISFYING ELLEN'S CONCERNS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0040058_0040381 WELL THERE'S A WHITE BOARD RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0040381_0040601 WE LOVE THIS THING
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0040601_0040784 SEE IF THE PENS WORK
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0040784_0041249 SO UM THIS IS UM A. 'S EYES RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0041249_0041412 AND B. 'S EYES
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0041412_0041879 AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DRAW THIS RIGHT IS THAT THEY YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0041879_0042304 IF UM FROM THIS TIME TO THIS TIME THEY'RE LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0042506_0043472 W WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW IN THE CRITICAL YOU WANNA KNOW AFTER THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PERIOD WITH THIS GUY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0043472_0043503 RIGHT

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0052714_0052735 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0052735_0052763 SO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0052889_0052912 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0054667_0054705 ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0056373_0056425 SO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0058925_0058951 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0059175_0059722 SO YOU KNOW HE MIGHT GET TRIANGLE ONE THERE AND NO MAYBE THIS ONE'S GONNA OVERLOOK LAP QUITE A BIT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0059722_0060725 SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS BE ABLE TO DEFINE UM BIGGER PERIODS WHICH IS THE PERIOD WHEN THEY'RE SORT OF INTERESTED IN TRIANGLE ONE OVERALL RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0060725_0060938 THIS IS SORT OF SOME META LEVEL ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0061634_0061708 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0061708_0062336 BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE N. X. T. QUERY LANGUAGE BUT IT YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN ANY YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0062336_0062902 THIS IS SUCH SPECIAL PURPOSE S BUT IT'S EASY ENOUGH GIVEN THE DATA FORMAT FOR ANY OF THESE THINGS TO DO THAT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0062902_0063833 SO YOU COULD DO IT ON 'CAUSE I IT'S JUST A MATTER OF I THE HARD PART IS DECIDING HOW CLOSE TOGETHER THESE HAVE TO BE BEFORE YOU DECIDE THAT THIS IS A EVENT THAT YOU WANNA PULL OUT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0063833_0064682 BECAUSE YOU KNOW ALGORITHMICALLY YOU'RE YOU'RE ALREADY PUTTING TOGETHER I MEAN THIS IS ESSENTIALLY ALREADY YOU KNOW THESE FIXATIONS WITH STUFF IN BETWEEN
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0064873_0065461 AND UH UM YOU KNOW WE WE'VE GOT AN ALGORITHM FOR DECIDING WHEN THAT'S A LOOK I GUESS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0065461_0065563 YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT OR NO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0066255_0066329 OH YEAH YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0066329_0066439 SO IT'S ALL FIXATIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0066439_0066845 THEY'RE THESE ARE ALL FIXATIONS AND SACCADES BUT WITHIN THE YEP
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0066845_0066976 SO THAT'S EASY ENOUGH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0066976_0067377 SO THE HARD THING IS THEY COULD BE MOVING THEIR EYE ARBITRARILY HERE RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0067377_0067756 AND YOU KNOW MAYBE EVEN HAVING FIXATIONS ON OTHER THINGS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0067756_0067788 YEAH

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0069469_0069766 SO UM THIS ISN'T YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0069766_0070724 BUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS WE WE CAN ALREADY BUILD INTO THIS G. D. F. FORMAT THESE REGIONS IF YOU CAN GIVE A DEFINITION OF WHAT YOU THINK THAT IS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0070724_0071461 BUT I THINK THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS IS TO BE ABLE TO INSPECT THE DATA IN UM SOME TOOL AND PLAY AROUND WITH THE DEFINITIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0071461_0071679 BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0071679_0071710 YEAH

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0072401_0072595 AND UH ELAN'S A REASONABLE CHOICE FOR THAT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0072595_0072863 WHAT YOU NEED IS SOMETHING WELL NO BECAUSE YOU NEED TO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0072924_0073569 Y YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0073569_0074308 SO I G I GUESS THIS IS A CASE OF CRAIG WRITING SOME SCRIPTS SO ROBIN HAVING SOME IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS AND SAYING
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0074308_0074644 YOU KNOW ADD THIS DATA A AUTOMATICALLY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0074644_0074769 IT I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT HARD RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0074769_0074960 IT'S JUST THERE'LL BE A BUNCH OF THESE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0074960_0075927 YOU'LL HAVE SOME RULES ABOUT HOW MAYBE HOW LONG YOU SPEND ON OTHER OBJECTS AND W WHETHER THE OTHER OBJECT IS UM THE EXISTING CONSTRUCTION OR NOT RIGHT

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0081909_0082106 BUT THAT'S LIKE A SEPARATE ANALYSIS RIGHT

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0084421_0085067 BUT WHAT WE FIND E WHAT WE CAN GET OUT OF THE DATA EASILY AT THE MOMENT IS AT THIS KIND OF LEVEL RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0085067_0085505 AND THEN IT'S A CASE OF DEFINING ALGORITHMICALLY ALL THESE OTHER TRANSFORMATIONS THAT YOU WANT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0085505_0085871 SO THIS IS ONE UH WE HADN'T THOUGHT OF ADDING BEFORE BUT WE SHOULD RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0085871_0086506 WHICH IS UM WELL HOW WOULD YOU DECIDE WHETHER SOMETHING WAS THE CURRENT ADDENDUM UH THE CU
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0086811_0087059 SO THAT'S A HUMAN DECISION

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0100974_0101493 BUT I MEAN WITH TRANSACTION CODING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU WOULD USE I Y YOU WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT VERBAL ANALYSIS EXACTLY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0101493_0101753 IT'D BE VERBAL PLUS ACTION
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0101753_0101972 BECAUSE IT'S A TASK BREAKDOWN
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0101972_0102091 IT'S JUST A SEGMENTATION
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0102754_0103352 YEAH BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE YOU YOU WOULDN'T DO TWO CODINGS FOR TASK LEVEL ONE YOU WOULDN'T DO TRANSACTION CODING IN A ACTION SEGMENTATION
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0104085_0104873 I I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALISTIC BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'D ACTUALLY DO IS USE UM THE FULL RECORD OF WHAT YOU HAVE AND DO A SEGMENTATION
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0104873_0105481 I THINK IT'D BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IF YOU USED LIKE JUST THE LANGUAGE WITHOUT WATCHING THE VIDEO TO DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE BREAKING DOWN THE TASK
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0105639_0106255 OH YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE CODING TH UH BASED ON THAT THOUGH AND THEN THAT SEEMS A STRANGE WAY TO GO ABOUT THINGS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0106255_0106475 I MEAN THIS THE LANGUAGE EVENTS ARE MULTI MODAL RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0106475_0106648 YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0107894_0108361 WHA WHY DO YOU CARE WHETHER THEY CAN DO IT JUST BASED ON THE THE LANGUAGE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0108361_0108391 IS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0110808_0111183 WELL IT SEEMS TO ME MUCH LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER THINGS ONE COULD GET OUT OF THIS DATA
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0111183_0111534 BUT I YOU KNOW I IT'S A POSSIBILITY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0111534_0111567 WE'LL
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0115050_0115065 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0115065_0115708 WELL I C I CAN SEE MAYBE WANTING TO KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN DO THE CHUNKING JUST BASED ON THE ACTIONS WITHOUT THE LANGUAGE IN CASES WHERE THEY USE BOTH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0115708_0116423 IT'S MORE G I CAN'T QUITE SEE WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO IT JUST BASED ON THE LANGUAGE WHEN W YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAD BOTH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0117030_0117061 UH-HUH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0117061_0117298 WELL I THINK THAT ONE'S JUST BOUND TO FAIL
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0117298_0117377 BUT YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0117944_0117983 REALLY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0118241_0118377 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0118377_0118410 ANYWAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0118885_0119363 SO BACK BACK TO THIS MAIN PROBLEM WHICH IS YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0119363_0120529 W THE RECORD THAT WE ARE GETTING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IS ABOUT THE M ABOUT THESE YOU KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT SOME REGION OF THE SCREEN DEFINED DYNAMICALLY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0120529_0121276 AND THEN WE NEED SOME WAY OF KNOWING WHAT THE YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE ADDING THESE OTHER ANALYSES ABOUT YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0121276_0122260 THEY'RE THEY'RE JOINTLY FOCUSED ON THIS REGION AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT S PERCENTAGE OF TIME THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT AS ADDING NEW TIERS OF INFORMATION TO EITHER THE ELAN TRACK OR N. X. T.
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0122260_0122493 THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH SORT OF TRACK BASED IN THIS WAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0122566_0122897 UM BUT THE HARD PART IS KNOWING HOW YOU WANNA DO THAT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0122897_0123416 AND I I THINK IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO THE G. D. F. FORMAT IS JUST THIS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0123416_0124080 AND THEN WE'VE GOT NO OPTION BUT TO UH FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS JUST EXPLORE THIS DATA
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0124080_0124792 SUGGEST WAYS ABOUT DOING IT AND UM BE ABLE TO PLAY THEM BACK AND SEE UM WHEN WE THINK WE'VE GOT THESE THINGS RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0124792_0125306 I DON'T THINK WE EVEN KNOW WHAT THE SET OF THESE THINGS ARE THAT WE WANT MUCH LESS HOW TO GET 'EM YET
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0125306_0125331 SO TH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0125674_0125769 YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0125769_0126104 SO THIS IS NOT THE YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE AIMING FOR
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0126104_0126705 BUT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS WHAT CRAIG PROGRAMS FOR THE INITIAL G. D. F. TRANSLATION
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0126705_0126764 UM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0127560_0127631 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0127631_0127888 SO LET'S JUST RETURN TO THIS QUESTION OF FRAME RATE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0127888_0128313 BECAUSE THIS IS THE THING WE WERE NOT PLANNING TO UM TRANSFER INTO THIS FORMAT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0128313_0128821 SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT A FRAME RATE KIND KIND OF CODING IS AG IT CAN AGAIN BE SEEN AS A TRACK
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0128821_0129457 BUT IT SAYS IT'S A CODING LIKE THIS RIGHT WHERE YOU SAY IT'S IN STATE A. STATE B. STATE C. STATE A.
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0131891_0131940 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0131940_0132030 SO YOU RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0132030_0132485 SO I'M JUST YOU'RE HAPPY THAT IT'S NOT GONNA HAVE FRAME RATE UH LIKE THIS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0132485_0132667 IT'S GONNA HAVE AN INTERPRETATION LIKE THIS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0133416_0133482 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0133482_0133525 SORRY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0134817_0134844 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0135308_0135398 W RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0135398_0136129 BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ELLEN'S CONCERNS MIGHT MEAN WE NEED TO ADD MORE INFORMATION TO THESE TAGS BECAUSE UM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0136129_0136734 YOU KNOW THIS THING IN ITSELF IS TH BUNCH OF FIXATIONS RIGHT WITH SACCADES
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0136970_0137409 FIXATIONS AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME THOSE FIXATIONS COVER YOU MIGHT WANT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0138517_0138559 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0138793_0138942 SO NUMBER OF FIXATIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0138942_0139060 PERCENTAGE OF
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0144618_0144650 NO NO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0144650_0145134 THIS IS THIS IS STILL UM UH SUMMARY DATA
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0145134_0145988 THEY'RE HE'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST ADDING ATTRIBUTES TO THESE THINGS THAT SAY THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THAT COUNTED AS THAT LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0145988_0146134 SO Y IT'S POSSIBLE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0150839_0150986 YEAH THE SPOTS'LL BE DIFFERENT ANYWAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0150986_0151283 'CAUSE I YOU'RE NOT GONNA G HAVE THE SAME PIXEL
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0151283_0151798 SO UM WE HAVE THE OPTION THAT WE CAN PUT IN AN A. FIXATION THING HERE RIGHT AS WELL
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0151798_0152264 IF YOU WANT THE SMALLER IF YOU WANT THE SMALLER CODING IN IN HERE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0152264_0152624 SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST PARSED INTO THIS IDEA OF WHICH OBJECT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0152624_0152936 BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE RAW FIXATION UM DATA
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0152936_0153085 WE CAN PUT THAT IN AS ANOTHER TRACK
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0153085_0153590 IF YOU THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT IN ONE OF THESE TOOLS THAT SHOWS YOU THE TRACKS AGAINST EACH OTHER
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0153897_0154053 YEAH I D THAT'S ALL HE ASKED FOR
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0154053_0154209 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0154209_0154281 WELL I THINK
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0154987_0155540 YEAH AND IN N. X. T. THERE'S NO COST RIGHT BECAUSE THE Y THE UH YOU JUST DON'T CHOOSE TO LOAD THOSE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0155540_0155907 ALL WE'RE DOING IS DUMPING IT AS OUTPUT THAT YOU CAN LOAD IF YOU CHOOSE TO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0155907_0156543 UM I G S YOU KNOW SO IF THEY'RE THINGS THAT YOU JUST KNOW ARE CRAZY AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT THEN WE DON'T DO IT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0156543_0156707 BUT OTHERWISE WE GO AHEAD AND DUMP 'EM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0156707_0156959 'CAUSE IT'S EASY TO DUMP OUT THE FIXATIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0156959_0157139 UM YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0157353_0157378 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0157378_0157862 SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THE DID YOU WANT THE YOU
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0158590_0159099 M NOT E WELL IF IT'S EACH YOU HAVE TO D YOU HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO ANOTHER TIER RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0159099_0159531 YOU CAN'T YOU CAN SAY THERE WERE THREE FIXATIONS AND THEY AVERAGED UH A CERTAIN TIME
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0159531_0159621 BUT YOU DON'T WANNA
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0159822_0160091 D WELL WHAT ABOUT THE THE OVERALL SUM OF THE DURATIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0160091_0160318 IS THAT I MEAN WHICH WAY DO YOU WANT TO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0160514_0160771 YEAH THEN THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0160771_0160840 THAT WAY AROUND
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0161053_0161101 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0161446_0162308 AND UH Y DID YOU WANT THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME FIXATED AS OPPOSED TO WHICH IS SORT OF ANOTHER VIEW OF THIS NUMBER
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0162308_0162484 YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY OF THESE AS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0162693_0162797 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0162797_0163454 WELL IT'S NOT UM THE THE EXTRA COST OF HAVING THESE AS ATTRIBUTES IS NOT HIGH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0163454_0163643 SO UM YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0163643_0164549 IT SAVES YOU I UH HAVING TO DO WRITE SCRIPTS TO DO ARITHMETIC ON THAT LATER IF YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT ARE GONNA BE USEFUL TO YOU
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0173372_0173409 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0176556_0176580 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0177332_0177385 I DON'T KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0178225_0178557 WELL WELL BUT Y THOSE ARE DIFFERENT TRACKS OF INFORMATION
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0178557_0179057 SO WHAT YOU WANT IS ONE TRACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH OBJECT IT'S ONE ONE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ON THE OTHER GUY'S GAZE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0179057_0179388 AND ONE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S ON UM ONE OF THE MOUSE POSITIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0180704_0181181 YEAH BUT I IN IN THE ANALYSIS YOU SHOULD TREAT THOSE AS COMPLETELY SEPARATE TRACKS OF INFORMATION
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0181181_0181888 BECAUSE THEY CAN BE LOOKING AT THEY COULD LOOK SIM SIMULTANEOUSLY AT SOMEBODY'S MOUSE SOMEBODY'S GAZE AND SOME OBJECT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0181888_0181934 SO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0182280_0182361 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0182361_0182504 SO THE THESE ARE INDEPENDENT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0182504_0183135 SO SO WHAT WE WANT IS WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT S AT THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0183135_0183773 AND SAY THEY ARE IN THIS PERIOD WELL I MEAN UH THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GIVEN WHAT I'VE TRYING TO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0184345_0184375 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0185170_0185194 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0186673_0186698 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0186884_0186970 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0186970_0187294 SO G SO THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF TRACKS HERE RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0187294_0187596 BECAUSE WELL WE JUST ADDED THIS FIXATION TRACK
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0187852_0188448 AND THEN THERE IS A. 'S MOUSE NOT THEIR EYES IS ON AN OBJECT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0188448_0188749 AND THE MOUSE MIGHT BE ON TRIANGLE ONE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0189009_0189132 BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0189132_0189484 I MEAN I THE MOUSE WE'RE JUST SAYING WHERE IS THE MOUSE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0189484_0189664 YOU KNOW IT'S ON THIS OBJECT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0189664_0190352 AND THEN UM A. 'S EYE IS ON WELL A. 'S MOUSE I GUESS RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0190352_0190606 A. 'S EYE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT A. 'S MOUSE HERE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0190844_0191263 A. 'S EYE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT B. 'S MOUSE HERE RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0191263_0191746 I MEAN THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING CROSS PRODUCTS AT THE THINGS THAT COULD BE CO LOCATED
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0191746_0191931 SO YOU JUST TREAT 'EM AS INDEPENDENT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0191931_0192217 AND I'M GUESSING FROM WHAT YOU SAY YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0192217_0192616 I GUESSING FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT ALL THESE TRACKS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0192616_0192691 YEAH WHICH IS FINE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0192691_0192816 THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH THAT AT ALL

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0195719_0196102 BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU DON'T TREAT THAT ENTIRE SET AS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0196102_0196755 IT'S JUST SO THA THE OBJECTS IS LIKE A SEPARATE LEVEL OF ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0196755_0196988 IF WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE OBJECTS THAN WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE GAZE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0196988_0197101 'CAUSE THEY CAN HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0198501_0198567 DOES THAT HAPPEN
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0198928_0199000 OH RIGHT

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0224135_0224401 IT'S THE UM THE WAY YOU DO THE ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0224401_0224898 BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE TO SAY UM YOU KNOW DID THEY JOINTLY LOOK AT TRIANGLE ONE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0224898_0224932 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0224932_0225119 DID THEY JOINTLY LOOK AT SQUARE ONE

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0225869_0226346 I THINK FOR NOW WE WE DO IT THIS WAY AND THEN WE WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED OUT OF IT IN THE END
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0226346_0226973 IT'S JUST YOU KNOW IN ELAN IT THAT HAS THE SIDE EFFECT THAT IF YOU GO FOR THE NATURALISTIC WAY OF OF UP TRANSLATING TO ELAN

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0227140_0227355 AND IT'LL PROBABLY RUIN THEIR VIEWER
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0227355_0227594 'CAUSE YOU'LL GET VERY SPARSE DATA ON EACH TRACK
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0227594_0228185 IT'LL BE LIKE THE OLD REFERRING EXPRESSION GENERALIS UH UH VISUALIZATION UM THE MAP TASK
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0228185_0228623 YOU KNOW WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT ONE OBJECT ONE LANDMARK AND THEN ANOTHER LANDMARK
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0228623_0228884 WELL IT'S BIG RIGHT

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0241802_0242092 IT'S THERE IS NO THE CONSTRUCT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0242533_0242885 WHAT WHY DOES IT WHY DOES CONSTRUCT ONE BECOME CONSTRUCT TWO WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TO IT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0243551_0243637 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0243637_0244044 OH AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IT TO STAY TRIANGLE ONE WHEN YOU START WITH A CONSTRUCT IT'S NOT A CONSTRUCT AT ALL
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0244044_0244111 IT'S JUST A ONE THING
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0244111_0244492 AND WE DON'T WANT TRIANGLE ONE TO SUDDENLY HAVE BIGGER STUFF
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0246776_0246866 YEAH YEAH THERE ARE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0246866_0246901 THERE ARE

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0261548_0261878 YOU DON'T BECAUSE THAT'S YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE HUMAN CODING TO DO THAT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0261878_0262259 YEAH THERE MIGHT BE MULTIPLE TRIANGLES THAT YOU'VE BROKE AND YOU WON'T KNOW WHICH ONE THEY'RE PLANNING ON USING IT FOR

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0266226_0266411 OH SO THERE'S NO TWO PARTS WITH THE SAME SHAPE

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0278175_0278336 SO IS THIS HARD WIRED INTO TIM'S PROGRAM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0278336_0278503 OR IS IT JUST AN ARTIFACT OF THE WAY WE S
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0279620_0279653 RIGHT

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0288850_0289268 I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW TO TRY TO SUMMARISE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0289268_0289869 UH WE WE THINK TIM'S PROGRAM CAN DO BOTH OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT YOU WANT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0289869_0290232 BUT I'M STILL WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE UH EFFECTS ARE FOR ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0290232_0290854 BECAUSE YOU WERE AIMING AT SOMETHING IN UM THE G. D. F. FORMAT AND I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0290854_0290881 AND W

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0292828_0293121 YOU KNOW EVERY BLACK TRIANGLE HAS A DIFFERENT I. D.
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0293121_0293518 AND YOU KNOW IT'S A BLACK TRIANGLE 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHICH MOLD IT CAME FROM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0293518_0293972 BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH PART IT WAS INTENDED TO REPLACE ON THE SCREEN BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MIND READ

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0300489_0300949 I THINK THAT THIS IS A HUMAN CODING THAT IS PART OF THE ACTION CODING
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0300949_0301525 BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW ANYBODY BUT A PERSON WATCHING THIS CAN GUESS WHY THEY CAST OFF THIS THING AT THIS TIME
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0307932_0308226 YEAH BUT THAT'S OKAY 'CAUSE THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT UNDERLYING PART NUMBERS
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0308226_0308373 AND WHEN YOU SAY WHAT A CONSTRUCT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0309175_0309247 NO

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0313498_0313858 IT'S JUST THE WHY THEY G WHY THEY GET NEW PARTS THAT'S THE PROBLEM FOR US
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0313858_0314550 WE CAN'T IF THEY SUDDENLY IF THEY DECIDE TO GET A PART OF A MOLD WE DON'T KNOW WE CAN'T KNOW WHY UNTIL THEY DO SOMETHING WITH IT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0314550_0314611 IF THEY DO
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0315327_0315478 OH YEAH YOU SAID THAT

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0316150_0316979 BUT YOU CAN BREAK YOU YOU CAN BUT YOU CAN BREAK ONE WHEN YOU BREAK ONE YOU DON'T CAST OFF THE MOLD YOURSELF IT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0316979_0317110 OH OKAY NEVER MIND THEN
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0317312_0317462 SO THEY JUST HAVE TO USE IT YEAH

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0328698_0329070 AND IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL WHETHER THEY BROKE SOMETHING INTENTIONALLY WITHOUT THE LANGUAGE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0329070_0329223 WHICH MEANS IT'S PROBABLY NOT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0329572_0329686 YEAH OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0329686_0329979 BUT TH UM THIS IS PROPERLY PART OF THE ACTION CODING

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0348650_0348852 OH DO YOU NEED TWO COPIES OF CAMTASIA TO DO THAT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0351397_0351513 SO YOU'RE GONNA LOOK INTO THIS RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0352273_0352479 WELL Y C LOOK AT THE LICENCE CONDITIONS IT MIGHT NOT

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0360138_0360300 SO THE SYNCHRONIZATION'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0361307_0361421 YEAH BEFORE THE TASK

AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0366255_0367006 SO THE FLASH GET ALLOWS YOU TO HAND SYNCHRONIZE THEM LATER IF YOU NEED TO BY STRIPPING EXTRA VIDEO OFF THE FRONT
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0367006_0367411 AS LONG AS YOU MAKE SURE YOU START 'EM BEFORE THE FLASH THEN YOU'RE FINE
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0367411_0367895 BUT IT WILL THERE'S A A COST OF HAVING TO GO TO BACK UP WHICH IS SYNCHRONIZING THEM
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0370147_0370202 OH OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H00_FEE083_0370202_0370504 SO YOU SO YOU SHOULD START THE CAMTASIA REALLY EARLY THEN

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0000095_0000384 YOU KNOW I I WANT EVERYTHING AND THEN I'LL DECIDE WHAT I WANT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0000533_0000564 OKAY

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0004027_0004171 WE CAN GET WE CAN ALWAYS GET BACK TO IT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0004171_0004455 WE'RE NOT TH ACTUALLY THROWING ANYTHING AWAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0004455_0004735 AND IF WE DECIDE TO RE JIG THIS AT SOME FINER
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0004908_0005034 MECHA METHOD
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0005034_0005438 WE'LL STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL AND A METHOD OF UH OF FILTERING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0005438_0005483 SO

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0006606_0006802 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0006802_0007331 AS LONG AS THE FORMAT IN WHICH WE PICK IT UP IS A FORMAT WHICH COULD BE GENERALISED TO A FINER TAKE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0007331_0008260 BECAUSE THE WORST THING THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN TO YOU IS YOU DISCOVER THAT YOU'VE DONE HUGE AMOUNTS OF ANALYSIS AND TH YOU ACTUALLY HAD THE DATA BUT YOU THREW IT AWAY BECAUSE YOU TREATED IT SO GROSSLY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0008260_0008304 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0008304_0009505 SO WHATEVER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO B YOU KNOW BACKTRACK AND SAY OKAY INSTEAD OF EVERY SECOND EVERY TENTH OF A SECOND OR SOME SUCH THING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0009505_0009602 BUT YOU KNOW TH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0010039_0010175 WELL THE EYE TRACKER DOES
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0010420_0010437 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0012128_0012184 WELL YOU NEED
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0012571_0012840 WELL ONE NEEDS TO KNOW THE DURATION OF THESE THINGS RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0012840_0012994 SO ONE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0013541_0013572 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0013900_0013933 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0014887_0015288 WELL SO THERE'S NO REAL TIME THERE'S ONLY EV THERE'S ONLY EVENTS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0015288_0015522 WHAT I'M WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHETHER WE'VE THROWN TIME AWAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0017045_0017106 HERE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0017631_0017662 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0017662_0018727 SO ONE OF THE FORMATS IN WHICH EYE TRACKER DATA IS ANALYSED IS PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT ON SOME TARGET AS OPPOSED TO SOME COMPETITOR OVER THE FIRST SECOND AFTER SOME EVENT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0018727_0018784 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0018784_0019627 SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE SHU HAVE TO SHOW AT SOME TIME SLICE RATE WHETHER THE EYE WAS ON THE SAME TARGET AS THE OTHER GUY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0019627_0019856 A SIMILAR TARGET WHAT WE'D BOTH BEEN DEALI YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0019856_0020784 SO WE HAVE TO B WE HAVE ALL THE PARTS THE INTERESTING PARTS OF THE SCREEN IDENTIFIED AND BE ABLE TO SHOW DISTRIBUTION OF GAZE OVER TIME
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0020784_0020880 ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0020880_0021469 NOW WE COULD BE REALLY UNLUCKY AND SOMEBODY WOULD EXPECT US TO DO THAT AT THE REAL FRAME RATE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0021469_0021584 BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY UNLUCKY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0021584_0022291 BUT BUT MY POINT IS THAT WE MUSTN'T THROW AWAY IN OR LOSE THE CAPACITY OF BEING ABLE TO DELIVER THAT KIND OF DATA
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0022291_0022413 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0022413_0022431 MM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0023064_0023404 S SO TYPICALLY THE EYE WILL MOVE RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0023404_0023958 SO OVER ANY ONE SECOND THEY EYE'S ACTUALLY F FIXING ON A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0023958_0024607 AND YOU AND SO WHEN YOU SAY THE EYE WAS ON THIS FROM HERE TO HERE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THAT IS THAT IF YOU USE THE REAL FRAME RATE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0024607_0024776 IT'S GONNA JIGGLE ALL OVER THE PLACE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0024776_0024892 IT'S GONNA BE ON THIS LANDMARK
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0024892_0025387 UH IT'S ON THIS OBJECT THAT OBJECT THIS FIXED THING THAT FIXED THING OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0025387_0025511 YOU'RE GONNA GET LOTS AND LOTS OF STUFF
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0025511_0025770 AND IT'S PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0025770_0025989 IT'S NOT UH I WENT HERE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0025989_0026120 I S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE PERSON WALKING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0026120_0026285 I WENT HERE I STAYED HERE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0026285_0026492 IT'S IT'S MORE LIKE A FLY HOVERING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0026892_0027024 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0027024_0027391 BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU TAKE THEM AS SEPARATE EVENTS YOU GET THOUSANDS OF SEPARATE EVENTS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0027657_0027695 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0028401_0028507 AGAINST BIGGER FRAMES
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0029339_0029513 WELL THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PROBLEM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0029513_0029633 THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DOING IT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0029633_0029864 ONE IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A CUT OFF RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0029864_0030337 BUT THE OTHER IS THAT THERE WILL BE A TIME SPAN A KIND OF REACTION TO SOME EVENT SPAN
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0030638_0030664 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0030989_0031030 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0031030_0031351 AND SO I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE REALLY TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0031351_0031993 ONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME OVERALL IN WHICH TWO PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME THING OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0031993_0032469 AND ONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SEQUENCES OF THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT THE SAME THING AND THEN THEY BROKE IT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0032469_0032741 OR THEY DID LOOK AT THE SAME THING AND THEN THEY DID OR DIDN'T BREA YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0032741_0032947 ONE ONE COULD IMAGINE THOSE TWO CATEGORIES
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0032947_0033382 THAT'S THAT'S A KIND OF TESTING OF OUR HYPOTHESES
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0033382_0034205 BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UM DUES YOU PAY TO THE WAY THEY DO THINGS IN THE LITERATURE TO GET YOUR PAPERS PUBLISHED
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0034205_0034661 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW IS AN EVENT SERIES AFTER SOME CRITICAL EVENT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0034661_0035006 WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TIME IS GIVEN TO LOOKING WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS LOOKING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0035006_0035477 AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TIME OVER SOME YOU KNOW REASONABLE TIME SPAN OF A COUPLE OF SECONDS ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0035477_0036170 SO THEY'LL BE THEY THEY'LL WANT TO SEE ESSENTIALLY THE GAZE SETTLING ON PARTICULAR INCIDENTS ON PARTICULAR PLACES
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0036170_0036511 SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THOSE TWO THINGS AND THEY'RE RATHER DIFFERENT DEMANDS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0039992_0040014 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0043677_0043960 OR HOW L ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0043960_0044707 LET'S LET'S IMAGINE A TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION EVENT OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0044707_0045496 THERE IS SOME PART THERE ARE THERE ARE SEPARATE MOVABLE PARTS ON THE SCREEN READY FOR USE RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0045496_0045986 THERE MAY BE OR NOT A CONSTRUCTION ALREADY BEGUN RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0045986_0046195 SOMEBODY MAKES THE FIRST MOVE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0046195_0046945 THERE'S SOME KIND OF COMMUNICATION EITHER GESTURAL IMAGINARY OR VERBAL THAT PLANS HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0046945_0047508 BEFORE THAT HAPPENS THE PERSON WHO SPEAKS IS GOING TO DO SOME KIND OF VISUAL SCANNING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0047508_0048108 WHILE THEY'RE SPEAKING OR COMMUNICATING IN SOME WAY THE OTHER PERSON MAY OR MAY NOT BE LOOKING WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0048108_0048473 THEY MAY BE OVERLAPPING GAZE AT PARTICULAR OBJECTS WHICH ARE OF INTEREST
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0048473_0048862 LET'S CALL IT THE C THE CONSTRUCT EXISTING CONSTRUCT WHICH COULD BE ZERO
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0048908_0048985 ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0048985_0049511 OR THE UM THE ADDENDUM THE THING WHICH IS NEXT GOING TO BE ADDED
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0049511_0049695 NEXT PIECE OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0049695_0050272 NOW IN NEITHER CASE WHEN YOU DRAW THIS HE'S LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE WHICH YOU'RE ACTUALLY DRAWING YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0050272_0050844 FOR A THE PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH HE'S STEADILY LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE IS GONNA BE VERY VERY SHORT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0050844_0051570 BECAUSE STARING FIXEDLY WITHOUT INTERRUPTION BLINK OR OR SACCADE IS IS AN EXTREMELY SHORT EVENT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0052520_0052652 THAT'S FINE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0052652_0052963 SO IT'S IN A REGION IT'S IN A REGION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0052963_0053032 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0053032_0053440 BUT EVEN SO YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET BOUNCING IN AND OUT OF THE REGION RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0053440_0054192 SO EVEN SO YOU WANNA LOOK AT IF WE'RE INTERESTED IN HOW LONG BEFORE THE CONSTRUCTION MOVE TAKES PLACE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0054192_0054462 UM HOW MUCH OF THE TIME THEY SPEND LOOKING AT THE SAME THING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0054462_0054659 LET'S CALL THAT OUR MEASURE OF ALIGNMENT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0054659_0055157 SO THEY'RE GONNA BE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT A. IS GONNA BE ON TRIANGLE ONE AND VARIOUS OTHER PLACES
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0055157_0055202 THAT'S RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0055202_0055609 AND AND B. UM OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0055609_0056115 AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF OF THAT TIME WHERE THEY'RE BOTH IN THE SAME REGION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0056296_0056354 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0056354_0057137 SO WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE DON'T UM SIMPLIFY DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0057137_0057449 TEMPORARILY SIMPLIFY TOO MUCH SO THAT YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0057797_0058091 'CAUSE THEN YOU LOSE PERCENTAGE AS AN AS A AS A D. V.
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0058337_0058361 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0058361_0058922 AND SO B. HAS SOME PERIODS OF LOOKING AT ONE AND ALL IT WILL WHICH WILL ALSO BE INTERMITTENT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0058922_0058982 BECAUSE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0059537_0059580 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0060708_0060770 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0060770_0060924 WHEN THEY SHOULD BE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0060924_0060946 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0061847_0061884 OKAY

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0065579_0065628 WELL
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0065805_0065837 IT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0066813_0066865 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0066865_0066888 WHAT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0067700_0067782 YES
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0067782_0068485 YES BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE FOR PART OF THAT TIME BOTH B. AND A. ARE PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0068485_0069304 IF IF YOUR INTENTION IS TO MOVE THE RED TRIANGLE TO SIT ON TOP OF THE THING ALREADY CONSTRUCTED YOU WOULD TEND TO LOOK BACK AND FORTH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0069304_0069325 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0069587_0069841 AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO FIGURE THAT OUT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0071618_0071665 YEAH SURE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0071665_0072409 SO SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE UNDER WHAT TOOL SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THESE EVENTS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0072409_0072445 SO
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0075905_0075925 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0075925_0077208 SO SO ESSENTIALLY THERE'S THERE'S UM A. E. IS DIVIDED INTO T. R. ONE AND C. AND OTHER STUFF OKAY WHERE C. IS THE CONSTRUCT THE EXISTING THING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0077792_0077841 WELL NO
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0077841_0078543 I MEAN WE'D TAKE A SEPARATE WE'D LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE TIME I MEAN I HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE LOOK WHEN THEY'RE BUILDING THINGS TOGETHER
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0078543_0078572 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0078572_0079047 SO THERE'S A THERE'S THE ADDENDUM AND THE AND THE CO THE EXISTING CONSTRUCT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0079047_0079366 AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA SPEND MORE TIME LOOKING AT ONE OR THE OTHER
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0079366_0079790 BUT IF THEY'RE WHATEVER IT IS THAT ONE IS LOOKING AT IF THE OTHER'S LOOKING THE SAME PLACE THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0079962_0079979 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0079979_0080061 SURE SURE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0080061_0080461 AND THAT'S WHAT THE OTHER STUFF THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THE DIAGONAL STRIPES ARE FOR
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0080461_0080577 THAT'S TRUE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0080577_0081563 BUT WE C WE CAN ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL BE DOING IS UM CATEGORISING PEOPLE I TAKE IT OR INTERACTIONS BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE SPEND LOOKING AT THE CLOCK
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0081563_0081880 WE'D EXPECT THAT IF WE PUT PEOPLE UNDER TIME PRESSURE THEY'LL LOOK AT THE CLOCK A LOT MORE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0082050_0082174 SURE IT'S A SEPARATE ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0082174_0082354 BUT YOU DON'T WANNA THROW IT AWAY RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0082354_0083113 SO SO YOU CAN DEFINE IF ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY CATEGORISED BY THE EYE TRACKER AS TO WHERE THE EYE IS ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0083113_0083993 YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL OUT ANY INTERESTING CATEGORY AND SAY ALRIGHT FOR THIS PHASE IT'S T. R. ONE OR C.
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0083993_0084455 FOR THIS PHASE IT'S UM S. Q. ONE OR C. OKAY

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0089033_0089632 YEAH THAT'S THE ADDENDUM IN THE CONSTRUCT SHOULD BE YOU KNOW KIND OF THEY THEY CHANGE THEIR TRUE IDENTITY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0089632_0090444 BUT THEY'RE I THEIR CATEGORIES OF STUFF NOW I W MY KIND OF ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THAT THIS WAS J. P. LAND
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0090444_0091191 THAT THAT'S WHAT HE WAS RE WHAT HE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN WAS THE KIND OF CODING WHICH WOULD DEFINE THE BUILDING SEQUENCE OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0091191_0091309 SO AND
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0091454_0092155 THE AND MAYBE HE WANTS TO THINK ABOUT THAT MORE AND SAY WELL THERE WERE SEVERAL CANDIDATES FOR THE ADDENDUM ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0092155_0092682 AND AND IT WAS THE NEGOTIATION OF WHICH CANDIDATE WAS GONNA BE THE RIGHT CANDIDATE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE INTERESTING STUFF
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0092682_0092813 SO I SHOULD TALK TO HIM ABOUT THIS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0092813_0093341 HE'S HE'S ACTUALLY UM EMAILED ME WITH A L WITH A LIST OF THINGS HE WANTS TO DISCUSS AT LENGTH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0093341_0093523 SO I W I'LL BRING THIS ONE BACK TO HIM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0093649_0093831 WELL THIS IS MY QUESTION FOR HIM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0093831_0094443 IS HE GONNA DEFINE THIS KIND OF BUILDING SEQUENCE IN A WAY THAT WE CAN GET OUT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0094443_0094905 OR IS HE SO B I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON CONSTRUCTION THERE FOR A WHILE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0094905_0095317 SO IT MAY BE THAT THEY HAVE A CODING SYSTEM THAT'S READY TO GO AND WE SHOULD JUST APPLY IT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0095608_0095713 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0095713_0096143 UM THEY DO A LOT OF SUB ASSEMBLY IN THE TASKS THEY'VE BEEN DOING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0096143_0096389 SO THEY MAY WELL HAVE A YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0096683_0096771 LET'S FIND OUT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0097069_0097159 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0097159_0097216 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0097216_0097438 SO WHA RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0097438_0097943 WHAT WELL WE BUT WE HAVE THE NOW ACTIONS I MEAN ACTIONS MIGHT MOSTLY BE THEIRS RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0097943_0098654 BUT SINCE WE HAVE THE THE EYE TRACKER I TH WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT GAZE RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0098654_0098819 YEAH I RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0098819_0099183 BUT UM SO THEY'LL THEY'LL UH THEY'LL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0099183_0099998 BUT UM PRESUMABLY WHAT YOU PIOUSLY HOPE IS HAPPENS HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH UM TRANSACTIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0099998_0100796 RIGHT THAT THE VERBAL ANALYSIS AND THE UM AND THE VISUAL ANALYSIS GIVE YOU THE SAME BREAKING POINTS THE SAME CHUNKING POINTS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0101759_0102003 WELL I MEAN WHAT YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0102003_0102180 IT'S IT IS IT IS A TASK BREAKDOWN
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0102180_0102758 BUT FOR THE VERBAL VERSION THERE ARE WAYS OF ANNOUNCING THAT NOW WE'RE DOING A NEW ONE RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0102758_0102883 OR THAT WE'RE FINISHED WITH THE OLD ONE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0103104_0103172 NO YOU WOULDN'T
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0103172_0103520 BUT I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0103520_0104083 AS AN AS AN OUTCOME OF THIS IS THAT YOU COULD ANALYSE EITHER END AND YOU'D GET THE SAME CHUNKING OF THE MATERIAL
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0104083_0104253 THE THING WHICH YOU GUYS THOUGHT TO MAKE IN A PAPER
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0105488_0105573 IT'S A HYPOTHESIS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0106244_0106294 WELL
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0106649_0106820 THEY ARE DOING THESE THINGS TOGETHER
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0106820_0107295 BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ONE COULD IMAGINE DOING IS UM SEN IS YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0107295_0108168 HAVING THE TRANSCRIPTION THERE AND PL JUST PLAY IT BACK TO A BUNCH OF CAPTIVE UNDERGRADUATES AND SAY WHEN DO THEY STOP AND START
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0108328_0108979 UM BECAUSE BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT UM CYCLING SEQUENCES IN DISCOURSE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0108979_0109325 AND IF THE DISCOURSE TELLS YOU WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S INFORMATION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0109325_0109667 I MEAN I G ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS HOW THE INFORMATION IS GONNA BE SHARED ACROSS THESE MEDIA
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0109667_0110222 AND IF YOU CAN GET IT ALL OUT OF THE SPEECH YOU KNOW IF THE IF ALL OF THE CHUNKING IS AVAILABLE WHEN THERE IS SPEECH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0110417_0110833 OKAY THEN IT'S CARRYING A LOT OF THE BURDEN
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0110833_0111011 IT'S SAYING WE ARE DONE WITH THAT AND
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0111254_0111327 MM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0111327_0111933 BUT THIS IS BUT WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT DATA LIKE THIS WITH THIS WITH OUR OLD FASHIONED ANALYSES UM YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0111933_0112697 AND I IT'S IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO KNOW THAT THAT MUCH INFORMATION THAT CHUNKING OF THE TASK INFORMATION IS BEING CARRIED BY THE LANGUAGE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0112697_0113132 BECAUSE J. P. 'S QUESTION THE OVERRIDING QUESTION IS SO WHAT'S LANGUAGE FOR
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0113132_0113156 YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0113156_0114395 IF PEOPLE ARE BUSY INTERACTING ALL THE TIME AND ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO CONTROL FOR WHETHER PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER WHEN THEY'RE DOING THESE JOINT TASKS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE IRRELEVANT 'CAUSE LANGUAGE IS IRRELEVANT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0114395_0114815 IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE NICE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN A PLACE WHERE WE'RE CONTROLLING WHETHER YOU HAVE LANGUAGE OR NOT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0114815_0115049 YOU COULD GET THE ENTIRE CHUNKING OF THE TASK OUT OF A LANGUAGE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0115456_0115536 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0115536_0115571 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0115700_0115742 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0116331_0116913 BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S A SELF CONTAINED SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO A SYSTEM WHICH IS WHICH CAN'T BE INTERPRETED WITHOUT THE OTHER SYSTEM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0117083_0117167 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0117167_0117266 USUALLY THE CLAIM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0117266_0117857 ALMOST ALL STUDIES ON LANGUAGE CLAIM THAT LANGUAGE IS A SELF CONTAINED SYSTEM WHICH WILL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0118006_0118117 THAT'S THE CLAIM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0118291_0118432 ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0118432_0118539 I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS TRUE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0118539_0118636 I SAID THAT'S THE CLAIM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0118636_0118756 AND SO IT'S WORTH TESTING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0119068_0119092 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0120400_0120445 MM-HMM

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0125217_0125257 NO NO
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0125257_0125618 AND WE WON'T AND ESTABLISHING THE FULL SET WILL YOU KNOW TAKE US MUCH OF THE PROJECT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0125618_0125761 SO YOU KNOW
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0126713_0126748 FINE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0126748_0127570 MY ONLY CONCERN W UH YOU A AS I SAID WHEN I BARGED IN WAS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T LOSE THE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO PICK UP LATER
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0127570_0127603 THAT'S ALL
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0128940_0129016 EVERY SINGLE FRAME
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0129199_0129241 WELL
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0129407_0129438 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0129438_0130354 BUT SINCE THE L THE DEFINITIONS OF LOOK A THING WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE D UM ARE THE ONES WHICH GET RID OF THE LOWER LEVEL
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0130354_0130783 LIKE JIGGLING AROUND IN THE AREA OF A PARTICULAR OBJECT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0130783_0131605 SO IF WE'RE MOVING THE THE GREEN TRIANGLE UM WE'VE DEFINED A REGION WHICH IS THE DYNAMICALLY THE GREEN TRIANGLE WHEREVER IT IS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0131605_0131720 WE WILL JIGGLE AROUND IN THERE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0131720_0131873 BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE ARE IN THERE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0131873_0132079 THAT'S BENEATH OUR LEVEL OF ANALYSIS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0132079_0132101 S
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0132661_0133332 WELL THE IN THAT INTERPRETATION IS DEFINABLE TO FRAME RATE BY OUR BY THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA USE FRAME RATE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0133508_0134354 I C WELL I MEAN I BECAUSE I CAN I CAN SAY FOR HOW MANY FRAMES THIS FIXATION WENT IS OFFICIALLY DEFINED
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0134354_0134778 SO THAT AS LONG AS I AS LONG AS IT'S NOT A UNTIMED EVENT OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0134778_0134990 A AND AN END TIME
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0134990_0135096 SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S FINE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0135096_0135240 I CAN SAY IT'S A LONG ONE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0135240_0135319 OR IT'S A SHORT ONE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0135319_0135572 OR IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S TWENTY MILLISECONDS MORE THAN THAT ONE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0135572_0135612 THAT'S
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0136690_0136717 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0138525_0138545 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0138714_0139027 AND OKAY I'M I'M ASKING YOU AS AN EXPERT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0139027_0139203 THIS IS THIS THIS ISN'T A LEADING QUESTION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0139203_0139406 THIS IS A QUESTION QUESTION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0139406_0139629 WHY WOULD THAT BE INFORMATIVE PARTICULARLY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0140107_0140140 UH-HUH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0141067_0141086 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0141227_0141277 UH-HUH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0141572_0141643 ON IT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0141643_0142696 SO YOU THINK THAT IF FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT UM ONE OR ANOTHER UM APEX OF A TRIANGLE IT WOULD JUST THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0142696_0143167 THEY WERE EXPLORING THE THING AS OPPOSED TO THEY WERE SIMPLY ALRIGHT THERE IS IT THERE IT IS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0143167_0143891 OKAY SO TH UM SO THAT REALLY MEANS THAT WE'RE NOT THROWING AWAY ABSOLUTE FIXATIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0144074_0144400 THE SCREEN LOCATION OF ABSOLUTE FIXATIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0145423_0145457 ALRIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0145940_0146060 UH-HUH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0146060_0146174 AS OPPOSED TO OUT OF IT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0146174_0146668 SO YOU SO I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD YOU TO MEAN EXPLORING THE FIGURE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0146668_0146892 BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR FIXATION IS A POINT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0146892_0147062 AND THE FIGURES ARE BIGGER THAN POINTS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0147062_0147628 SO YOU COULD BE EXPLORING THE FIGURE OR YOU COULD BE JUST SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION DEFINED AS THE FIGURE BUT NOT ON IT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0148141_0148245 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0148245_0148322 ALRIGHT FINE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0148322_0148343 THE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0148512_0148830 SO YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW THE VARIABILITY OF THE OF THE FIXATION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0148830_0149006 AND WOULDN'T THAT DIFFER FROM PERSON TO PERSON
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0149924_0149951 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0149951_0150928 SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SPOTS WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE EYE HAS FIXED THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIX OH OK OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0150928_0151050 SO IT'S A JIGGLE RATE OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0151207_0151239 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0151808_0151835 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0153568_0154053 WELL ALL I TH UNDERSTOOD YOU TO ASK FOR WAS THE DURATION OF EACH FIXATION INSIDE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0154053_0154081 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0154470_0154545 YOU CAN COME BACK
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0155951_0155999 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0156609_0156644 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0157060_0157342 SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIXATIONS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0157503_0157684 WELL ACTUALLY DO YOU WANT THE AVERAGE DURATION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0157684_0157831 OR DO YOU WANT THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ONES
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0158377_0158597 DURATION OF EACH FIXATION IN THE REGION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0160159_0160265 WELL YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THAT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0161056_0161321 SO THAT'S A MEASURE OF JIGGLE IN THE REGION ROUGHLY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0162134_0162174 MOVING
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0164164_0164188 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0164492_0164973 WHAT'S OUR ERROR OF MEASUREMENT ON LOCATION ON THE SCREEN
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0164973_0166041 SO TO WHAT DEGREE DO WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHETHER THE TWO LITTLE EYES LITTLE CIRCLES ARE EXACTLY IN THE SAME PLACE OR JUST SOMEWHERE IN THE SAME REGION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0166308_0166375 RIGHT OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0166629_0166658 RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0167584_0167618 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0168032_0168155 IT'S YEAH OKAY RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0168450_0168472 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0168472_0168959 SO MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT THE THE MOUSE IS A DYNAMIC OBJECT RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0168959_0169158 THE EYE TRACK IS A DYNAMIC OBJECT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0169158_0169786 OR IS IT ONLY THE THE PIECE THAT THE EYE TRA THE OTHER PERSON'S EYE TRACK IS ON THAT'S THAT'S AN OBJECT IN THIS DEFINITION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0170039_0170264 IS A IS AN OBJECT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0170264_0170292 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0170292_0170773 WITH SOME WITH PLUS OR MINUS SOMETHING OR OTHER YEAH AROUND IT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0170773_0171060 SOME CIRCULAR AREA
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0171060_0171170 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0171170_0171270 AND
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0171548_0172042 UM SO YOU CAN BE ON THE OBJECT BUT NOT ON THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0172042_0173118 SO THERE CAN BE A TRIANGLE WHICH HAS A. 'S GAZE IN THE CENTRE AND YOUR GAZE ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO BE HERE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0173118_0173391 YOU'RE IN THE TRIANGLE REGION
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0173391_0173451 DOES THIS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0173821_0173853 OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0174639_0175275 BUT IT'S DIRECTLY ADDED WHEN WHEN THESE TWO IN THIS SITUATION WHEN THESE TWO OVERLAP RIGHT LIKE THIS
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0176001_0176026 MM-HMM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0176180_0176206 MM-HMM

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0176852_0177089 WELL IT WOULD COME UP IT WOULD SAY YES RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0177089_0177367 I MEAN BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN THE SAME PLACE
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0177367_0177775 SO IF YOU Y YOU'RE GONNA HAVE DYNAMIC REGIONS WHICH OVERLAP ONE ANOTHER BY DEFINITION

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0184390_0184602 SO NOW THAT'S THE CONSTRUCT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0184602_0185181 AND BOTH MOUSE SYMBOLS ARE ON IT RIGHT

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0192997_0193427 AND THERE ARE TWO MEASURES OF WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS DIRECTING ATTENTION THAT YOU GET FROM THE VISUAL TRACK

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0198334_0198462 OKAY WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0198622_0199026 YEAH BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THEM CLOSE TOGETHER THERE'S ALWAYS SOME FUZZ FACTOR AROUND THEM
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0199026_0199600 AND SO IF THEY'RE LEFT LYING CLOSE TOGETHER OKAY OR IN THE IN FACT IN THE MODEL IN THE NOT IN THE MODEL

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0223413_0224141 I MEAN I I ACTUALLY LIKE THE SOLUTION HOWEVER UGLY IT IT LOOKS IN TERMS OF A DATA FORMAT OF HAVING A TRACK FOR EVERY POSSIBLE OBJECT OF GAZE

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0235654_0236153 SO YOU CHA SO EVERY TIME A PART IS ADDED TO THE CONSTRUCT IT BECOMES A NEW PART
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0236153_0237001 SO THE CONSTRUCT ACTUALLY UM HAS SAY IT HAS SIX THINGS THAT ARE ADDED TO SOME INITIAL THING OKAY
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0237001_0237536 SO IF THERE'S JUST THE INITIAL THING YOU'VE PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN THAT'S JUST THE INITIAL OBJECT RIGHT

AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0237828_0238419 BECAUSE WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER PART CONSTRUCT ONE CEASES TO EXIST AND YOU GET CONSTRUCT TWO RIGHT
AMI_EN2009d_H01_FEE096_0238419_0238976 SO ACTUALLY DEFINING ALL OF THOSE AS THE CONSTRUCT IS GONNA BE THE TRICKIEST THING

AMI_EN2009d_H03_MEE095_0246969_0247366 SO THAT I'M ACT THERE'S ACTUALLY A S A SEPARATE FILE OF THE DATA FORMAT WHICH SAYS FOR EACH CONSTRUCT
AMI_EN2009d_H03_MEE095_0247366_0247784 WHICH WHICH TWO PARTS MADE IT MADE THAT CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT CONSTRUCT
AMI_EN2009d_H03_MEE095_0248537_0248580 YEAH
AMI_EN2009d_H03_MEE095_0248580_0248842 BUT YOU CAN STILL TA YOU CAN STILL TRACK WHAT PARTS WENT INTO IT

AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0096480_0096786 IS INSTALLING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0114273_0114729 UM I THINK IT'LL BE THE MID RANGE TO THE HIGH END MARKET IN TERMS OF PEOPLE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0114729_0115224 'CAUSE TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR A REMOTE HOW MUCH IS THAT LO LOCALLY IN POUNDS
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0115379_0115831 IS THAT TOO IS THAT A LOT OF MONEY TO BUY AN EXTRA REMOTE OR A REPLACEMENT REMOTE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0115831_0115909 RIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0115909_0116595 UM SO MAYBE NOT THE HIGH END RANGE BUT MAYBE MIDDLE MIDDLE UP ISH

AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0116794_0117246 I DUNNO I GUESS YOU PAY WHAT TEN TEN QUID FOR A REMOTE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0117246_0117377 LIKE A SIMPLE REPLACEMENT RIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0117377_0117841 I MEAN IF YOU LOST YOUR REMOTE AND THE FIRST THING YOU JUST WANNA GO OUT AND GET WOULD YOU HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0118075_0118092 YEAH
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0119833_0119856 YEP
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0124913_0125805 I I THINK TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE IS IS IS FAIR TO ADD THAT IN AS A GROUP AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S MORE THAN HALF YOUR GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO AT LEAST TRY AND USE YOUR TECHNOLOGY
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0126169_0126193 YEAH
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0126508_0126990 I THINK PERHAPS THAT AGE GROUP IS SIGNIFICANT AS WELL BECAUSE THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO USE THE COMPUTER
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0126990_0127396 WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR WITH COMPUTERS IN IN THEIR EVERYDAY WORK
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0127396_0127789 I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE ABOUT I WOULDN'T SAY THIRTY FIVE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0127789_0128630 BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT FORTY ISH AND ABOVE NOW WOULD NOT BE SO DEPENDENT AND RELIANT ON A COMPUTER OR A MOBILE PHONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0128630_0128780 SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GADGETY RIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0128780_0129148 PEOPLE WHO ARE U GROWING UP USED TO YOU KNOW IN SCHOOLS AND IN UNIVERSITIES
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0129148_0129540 WHEN YOU GO ON TO THEIR WORKING LIVES PEOPLE WHO WOULD YOU KNOW REGULAR YEAH

AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0129660_0129707 MM
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0130799_0131394 I I THINK ONE THING WE SHOULD TRY NOT TO AVOID IS NOT TO SAY WE HAVE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION RIGHT NOW
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0131394_0131916 BECAUSE UM BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE GO Y EVERYBODY'S SAYING RIGHT YOU WANT SOMETHING SIMPLE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0131916_0132234 YOU WANT BASIC STUFF AND YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S EASY TO USE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0132234_0132604 SPEECH RECOGNITION MIGHT NOT BE THE SIMPLEST THING FOR SOMEBODY TO USE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0132784_0133353 UM BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO LOCK OURSELVES INTO A S PARTICULAR KIND OF TECHNOLOGY
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0133353_0133862 RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON ON EXACTLY WHAT ARE THE FEATURES THAT WE'RE GONNA SAY AND THEN
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0133862_0134333 YOU KNOW SAY SPEECH RECOGNITION IS GOOD FOR THIS SPEECH RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD FOR THIS
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0134333_0134915 SO MAYBE WE SHOULD I SUGGEST THAT WE THINK ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION ANYWAY IT'S A IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USED TO FULFIL A FUNCTION
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0134915_0135294 BUT AT END OF THE DAY WE DON'T LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY BUT WE LOOK AT THE FUNCTION FIRST
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0135733_0135774 OKAY SURE

AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0142871_0143416 UM I GUESS I TRY TO DEFINE LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW TRY TO DEFINE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET DONE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0143416_0143718 UM I THINK IN A PRACTICAL WAY WE KIND OF KNOW WHAT IT IS
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0143718_0144405 WE'VE USED IT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT BUT WE'RE WE CAN'T N WE HAVEN'T NARROWED DOWN UM EXACTLY WHAT THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO FULFIL
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0144405_0144916 LIKE BESIDES THE BASICS I THINK BACK IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS WE KNOW WHAT THE BASICS ARE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0144916_0145556 HAS TO CHANGE CHANNELS HAS TO CHANGE VOLUME BUT IN LIKE SPECIFICS RIGHT WHICH ONE OF THE BASICS ARE YOU TRYING TO TARGET
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0145556_0145990 UM ARE THERE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BASICS THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT OR LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE BASICS
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0145990_0146890 UM AND I JUST THE IDEA IS JUST TO GET EVERYBODY TO UM I USUALLY HAVE A HAVE HAVE A DESIGN THAT'S THERE AS A BASIC
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0146890_0147254 SO YOU KNOW THINGS THAT TO START EVERYTHING GOING
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0147254_0147609 BUT I GUESS EVERYBODY DOES HAVE SOME IDEA SO I DON'T THINK UM THERE'S A NEED FOR THAT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0147709_0148334 UM OKAY THIS FINDING THINGS IS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING SO I'LL GO INTO THE DIAGRAM FIRST
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0148334_0148800 IT JUST EXPLAINS HOW THE PROCESS GOES THROUGH FROM A FROM THE BASIC TECHNOLOGY POINT OF VIEW
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0148800_0149249 THE BASIC STEPS THAT YOU NEED UM IN THE DIAGRAM AND IN THIS SLIDE PROBABLY WORKS BETTER
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0149249_0149588 UM OKAY YOU NEED SOME POWER SOURCE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0149588_0149827 'KAY A BATTERY OR SOMETHING TO KEEP IT GOING
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0149827_0150513 UM AND THAT POWER SOURCE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT TIES YOU DOWN TO UM HOW LONG THE DEVICE WILL LAST
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0150513_0151455 UM IT TIES YOU DOWN PERHAPS A BIT LATER ON IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGIES UM HOW FAR YOU CAN TRANSMIT THE SIGNAL OR THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU WANT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0151455_0151658 LIKE FOR EXAMPLE VOICE RECOGNITION RIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0151658_0152371 THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRAINED BECAUSE THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO POWER A MICROPHONE YOU MIGHT NEED TO POWER OTHER THINGS SO THAT'S ONE PERHAPS CONSTRAINT THERE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0152371_0152426 UM
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0152503_0153510 TH OKAY THE BASIC THING IS THERE'S A USER INTERFACE WHERE PEOPLE PUNCH A BUTTON OR TALK INTO IT OR SMILE TO IT OR BLINK THEIR EYES WHATEVER
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0153510_0153885 YOU KNOW AND THAT UM PICKS UP AN INPUT FROM A USER
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0153885_0154487 UM UH A LOGIC A SERIES OF LOGIC HAS TO DECIDE WHAT THE USER IS TELLING THE DEVICE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0154487_0155001 AND THE DEVICE HAS TO R YOU KNOW BASED ON YOU PUSH BUTTON A. SO I WILL DO SOMETHING WITH BUTTON A.
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0155001_0155264 SO MAYBE BUTTON A. IS THE POWER BUTTON OKAY
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0155264_0155786 UM AND THEN IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND THE SIGNAL OUT TO THE DEVICE ITSELF WHICH IS THE RECEIVER HERE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0155786_0156287 UM AND I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF MY DESIGN UM
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0156287_0157100 IT'S FAIRLY GENERAL UM AND I GUESS THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS ALSO NOT TO RESTRICT YOU IN IN THE WAY YOU'RE THINKING LIKE UM VOICE RECOGNITION
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0157100_0157828 RIGHT UM IF IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS IMPORTANT THEN WE JUST ADD MORE POWER RATHER THAN HAVING A THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0157828_0158651 SO IT'S NOT REALLY A CONSTRAINT IN THAT SENSE BUT I MEAN THESE ARE FUNCTIONALLY YOU KNOW THE BASE WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS TO DO
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0158651_0159173 UM SO I GUESS THE REST OF IT I THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE YOU YOU WANNA GO BACK TO WHAT THE FUNCTIONS ARE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0159173_0159437 I THINK THAT'S MORE RELEVANT TO A DISCUSSION
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0159737_0159884 YEAH W I'M DONE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0159884_0159960 MORE OR LESS
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0159960_0160064 YEAH
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0160064_0160500 PS OH IT'S JUST PUTTING THE REST OF IT INTO WORDS BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0160500_0161081 UM YOU HAVE A TRANSMITTER AN INPUT DEVICE LOGIC CHIP YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0161081_0161127 UM
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0161286_0161365 I GUESS THIS WOULD BE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0161523_0161537 YEP
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0162371_0162727 UM THESE THESE AREN'T TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS IN THAT SENSE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0162727_0163263 THIS IS JUST UM A BASIC PRINCIPLES AND BASIC COMPONENTS THAT ARE NEEDED
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0163263_0163859 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU NEEDED UM IF YOU NEEDED TO ADD UH A VOICE RECOGNITION RIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0163859_0164631 THEN YOUR USER INTERFACE WOULD BE SPLIT BROKEN DOWN INTO MORE COMPONENTS RIGHT WHICH YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE THE V. R. AND STUFF LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0164631_0164660 UH
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0164765_0164834 YEP
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0164834_0164868 YEP
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0164868_0165470 SO EACH COMPONENT REPRESENTS ONE FUNCTION BUT I THINK THE BASIC FUNCTIONS ARE THE LOGIC THE TRANSMITTER
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0165470_0166006 UM AND THE RECEIVER OKAY AND THE POWER ARE THINGS THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0166006_0166548 UM AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT BASED ON WHAT YOUR USER INTERFACE REQUIRES THEN WE'LL ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITY TO IT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0166548_0167425 UM THERE MIGHT BE ONE OTHER CONSIDERATION WHICH WOULD BE THAT THE THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. FOR EXAMPLE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0167425_0168047 OKAY UM ARE WE GONNA RESTRICT OURSELVES TO USING THE TRADITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES OF INFRA RED THING
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0168047_0168413 BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY BE PHYSICALLY BE POINTING TO
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0168413_0168467 RIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0170369_0170395 YEP
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0170723_0171313 THERE MIGHT BE ONE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION UM IN PARTICULAR RIGHT NOW SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0171313_0171807 UM IF SOMEBODY'S GONNA H TALK TO THE DEVICE YOU IDEALLY WANT THEM TO HOLD IT TO THEM
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0171807_0172341 I IT YOU MAY NOT REQUIRE THAT BUT YOU KNOW UM IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING VERY NATURAL I GUESS
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0172341_0172838 YOU KNOW TO HOLD IT TO SIGNAL TO THE USER AND PUSH A BUTTON MAYBE TO START S TALKING ABOUT IT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0172838_0173496 THEN YOU NEED TO SEND THE SIGNAL OUT SO BECAUSE IF YOU'RE USING INFRA RED THE LINE OF SIGHT UM SAY THE T. V. 'S AT THAT CHAIR
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0173496_0173857 AND I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF HERE AND THE TRANSMITTER IS HERE IT BLOCKS IT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0173857_0174449 SO IN THAT SENSE THERE'S NOT REALLY A RESTRICTION BUT IT'S SOMETHING WHICH YOU MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT LATER ON IN THE PROCESS
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0174449_0174594 NOT SO MUCH FURTHER DOWN
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0175946_0176895 THERE'S THERE'S NOT MUCH SPECIFIC SPECIFIC INFORMATION BUT I THINK THAT UM ONE INDICATION OF INFRA RED MEAN THAT YOU'RE JUST TARGETING TRADITIONAL DEVICES
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0176895_0177064 BECAUSE INFRA RED IS SOMETHING WHICH EVERYBODY HAS
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0178793_0179321 THERE'S A THERE'S OKAY FROM FROM A FROM A COMPONENT POINT OF VIEW THERE'S ADDED COMPLEXITY
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0179321_0179886 AND YOU ADD COST TO IT UM AND THEN THERE'S PROBABLY THE FACT THAT YOU NEED ANOTHER PHYSICAL COMPONENT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0179886_0180231 YOU NEED A DOCKING CRADLE FOR EXAMPLE FOR YOU TO PUT IT IN TO CHARGE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0180231_0180493 OR YOU NEED TO GET THE USER TO PLUG IT IN
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0180493_0181075 UM AND MOST USERS ARE VERY F USE ALREADY USED TO THE IDEA OF BUYING BATTERIES AND PUTTING IT INTO THE CONTROLLER
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0181075_0181731 BUT UNLESS THE CONTROLLER'S GONNA CONSUME A LOT OF BATTERIES LIKE HE'S GONNA RUN THROUGH LIKE TWENTY BATTERIES A MONTH
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0181731_0182243 THEN I DON'T THINK RECHARGEABLE IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED TO CARE ABOUT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0182243_0182289 UM
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0188818_0188874 OKAY I THINK
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0191661_0192036 ANOTHER THING THAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT CATEGORISING THE CONTROLS
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0192036_0192502 UM MAYBE I COULD SUGGEST WE WE BREAK THEM DOWN INTO THREE SIMPLE CATEGORIES
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0192502_0193028 ONE WOULD BE AUDIO CONTROLS ONE WOULD BE VIDEO CONTROLS AND THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE A DEVICE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0193028_0193969 UM THIS MAY NOT MAP VERY WELL TO ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY ESPECIALLY BUT I THINK THAT UM FROM A MANUFACTURER'S POINT OF VIEW FROM A PERSON DESIGNING THE DEVICE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0193969_0194612 BUT I THINK FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF A PERSON USING THE DEVICE YOU KNOW A T. V. IS SOMETHING THEY SEE AND SOMETHING THEY HEAR
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0194612_0194966 UM IT'S SOMETHING THEY DO OTHER THINGS TO LIKE TURN IT ON AND TURN IT OFF
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0194966_0195480 I MEAN LIKE SO WHAT WE COULD HAVE IS LIKE THREE BUCKETS RIGHT WHERE WE COULD THROW THINGS INTO LIKE IF WE WANT THIS FEATURE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0195480_0195955 LET'S THROW IT INTO THERE AND THEN FROM THERE DECIDE WHETHER IT'S BASIC OR IT'S NON BASIC
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0195955_0196185 I MEAN IT MIGHT HELP WITH THE VISUALISATION
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0196185_0196489 AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP WITH THE COMPONENT BUILD AS WELL
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0202275_0202380 MM NO NOT REALLY
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0204223_0204246 MM
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0204861_0205079 UM THINGS LIKE ON OFF
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0205079_0205344 BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU SEE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0205344_0206215 I ME MEAN IN TERMS OF PICTURE AND THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE YOU KNOW UM SO UM AND CHANNEL
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0206215_0206687 BECAUSE THE ON OFF ALSO GOES YOU KNOW LIKE ON OFF LIKE POWER NOT ON OFF SOUND
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0206687_0206869 NOT ON OFF VIDEO
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0206869_0207115 ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T TURN OFF THE VIDEO ON YOUR T. V.
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0207115_0207551 BUT UM YOU MIGHT WANNA YOU KNOW TURN OFF THE SOUND SAY YOU WANNA PICK UP THE PHONE THERE'S A MUTE BUTTON RIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0207551_0208219 SO YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF PUTTING IT ON TO UM OTHERS OR A DEVICE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0208219_0208505 DEVICE IS BASICALLY ANYTHING WHICH WE CAN'T CATEGORISE RIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0208505_0208560 WE PUT IT OUT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0209054_0209254 YEAH ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU HEAR RIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0209254_0209411 YOU YOU PUT THAT INTO AUDIO
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0209411_0209817 AND THEN VIDEO IS ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN SEE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0209817_0209867 UM
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0209981_0210008 YEP
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0210238_0210257 YEP
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0210510_0210528 YEP
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0211634_0212046 LIKE RANDOM WHICH WE HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO PUT BUT WE NEED IT SOMEWHERE THERE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0212046_0212562 UM EVEN EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MAP VERY CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPLE AT LEAST HAVE SOME IN THEIR MIND
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0212562_0212653 IT'S EASY TO USE
AMI_ES2002b_H00_MEE006_0212653_0213466 I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT UM AND I GUESS FROM THE COMPONENT POINT OF VIEW IT'S EASY TO BUILD AS WELL 'CAUSE THINGS ARE LIKE FIXED
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0001459_0001542 IS THAT ALRIGHT NOW
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0001694_0001791 OKAY
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0001966_0002039 SORRY
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0002328_0002534 OKAY EVERYBODY ALL SET TO START THE MEETING
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0002534_0003461 OKAY WE'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR FOR THIS ONE UM TO UH DISCUSS THE UM FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0003461_0003554 ALL READY TO GO
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0003554_0003697 OKAY
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0003697_0004439 UM SO HOPEFULLY YOU'VE ALL BEEN WORKING AWAY AND I'VE PUT THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0004439_0005055 UM SO I GUESS JUST TO TO RECAP ON UH WHAT WE DID LAST TIME
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0005055_0006050 UM KIND OF UH GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT AND UH GOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE EQUIPMENT AND STARTED TO DISCUSS UM A BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0006050_0006414 YOU KNOW COST WISE HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAD TO S
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0010092_0010429 UM JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE THREE NEW REQUIREMENTS
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0010429_0011479 UM WHICH IS THE THE FIRST ONE IS THAT UM UH THE COMPANY'S DECIDED THAT TELETEXT IS OUTDATED UH BECAUSE OF HOW POPULAR THE INTERNET IS
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0011479_0012194 NOBODY USES TELETEXT VERY MUCH ANYMORE SO WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER THAT IN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0012194_0013069 UM THEY'VE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT WE UM WE ONLY USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO CONTROL THE TELEVISION NOT THE V. C. R. D. V. D. OR ANYTHING ELSE
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0013069_0013966 I THINK THE WORRY IS THAT IF THE PROJECT BECOMES TOO COMPLEX THEN IT'LL AFFECT UM HOW LONG IT TAKES US TO GET IT INTO INTO PRODUCTION
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0013966_0014168 THE TIME TO MARKET
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0014168_0014541 SO UM WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP IT SIMPLE AND IT'LL JUST CONTROL THE T. V.
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0014541_0015049 AND THE OTHER THING WAS THAT THE COMPANY WANT THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0015121_0015497 UM I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE CORPORATE COLOUR IS
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0015497_0015812 IT MIGHT BE YELLOW BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF YELLOW EVERYWHERE
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0016316_0016572 WELL THAT'S THE THING I'M I'M NOT SURE UM
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0016649_0017148 UH TH BECAUSE ON THE THE COMPANY WEBSITE UH WHAT DOES IT SAY
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0017242_0017300 UH SOMETHING
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0017399_0017930 YEAH I MEAN DO THEY IS THAT SOMETHING THEY WANT ACTUALLY WRITTEN ON IT 'CAUSE IT'S QUITE LONG
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0018007_0018230 UM OR YEAH JUST THE IDEA BUT I'M NOT SURE
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0018230_0018396 SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS AS WELL
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0018396_0019000 SO THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS JUST NOT TO WORRY ABOUT TELETEXT UH ONLY CONTROL THE T. V.
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0019000_0019619 AND UM AND UH INCORPORATE THE UH COLOUR AND SLOGAN OF THE COMPANY
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0019619_0020457 UM SO IS EVERYBODY OKAY WITH ANY OF THAT OR DO YOU WANT ME TO RECAP AT ALL
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0020457_0020679 RIGHT UM TIME FOR PRESENTATIONS THEN
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0020679_0020800 WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0021113_0021183 OKAY COOL
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0021983_0022138 OH YEAH OF COURSE YEAH
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0022138_0022211 G GO ON AHEAD
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0027445_0027485 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0028745_0028819 OKAY
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0031511_0031629 ALRIGHT
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0034586_0034637 OOP
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0038673_0038863 UM
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0038863_0039243 WELL WE CAN CHAT AWAY FOR UH FOR FIVE MINUTES OR SO I THINK AT AT MOST
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0039243_0039356 JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES ANYWAY
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0041100_0041266 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0041266_0041511 SHALL WE SH WELL WE'LL STICK TO KIND OF YOUR AREA FOR NOW
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0041754_0041794 YEAH
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0042724_0042856 LOOKS KIND OF YEAH
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0043406_0043558 WELL I THINK IT'S A VALID POINT
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0043558_0044405 I MEAN LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT LOOKS QUITE UM QUITE COMPLICATED AND THAT P. R. T. P P. R. O. T. THING IS INCREDIBLY CONFUSING
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0044405_0045098 UM SO I SEE I SEE WHY YO YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT PREFER THE SIMPLER DESIGN BUT YEAH YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE OUT ON
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0045098_0045580 YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES SO MAYBE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU GET A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE YOU KIND OF FLIP THE THING OPEN
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0045580_0045741 I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
AMI_ES2002b_H01_FEE005_0045741_0045990 I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA

AMI_ES2002b_H02_MEE007_0029573_0030170 THERE'S EITHER UM A VERY COMPLICATED ONE THAT'S GOT LOTS OF BUTTONS LOTS OF COLOURS VERY CONFUSING YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
AMI_ES2002b_H02_MEE007_0030170_0030470 UM IN THAT CASE THE THE LABELLING TENDS TO BE VERY BAD

AMI_ES2002b_H02_MEE007_0032013_0032343 THAT ONE'S PERG AND THAT ONE'S PROG AND IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHAT IT DOES

AMI_ES2002b_H02_MEE007_0034020_0034790 IT'S GOT ONLY THE BASIC FUNCTIONS MM BUT UM IT'S THE SAME SIZE AS THE THE HARD TO USE ONE
AMI_ES2002b_H02_MEE007_0034790_0034957 UH IT LOOKED A BIT CLUNKY
AMI_ES2002b_H02_MEE007_0034957_0035369 THEY'RE VERY BIG AND NOT VERY MUCH USE FOR BUTTONS
AMI_ES2002b_H02_MEE007_0035369_0035733 UM AND IT'S JUST VERY HARD TO ACCESS THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
AMI_ES2002b_H02_MEE007_0035733_0035937 THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING FOR INSTANCE FOR A SLOW MOTION BUTTON

AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0082034_0083410 SO WHAT I BASICALLY GOT IS I JUST LOOKED INTO SOME INFORMATION AND SORT OF TH TRIED TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW WE COULD REVIEW IT AND HOW WE COULD AND WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS WE COULD TAKE AWAY FROM IT AND THEN MAYBE BY THE END OF JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE THINGS WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR PRIORITIES
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0083410_0083670 'CAUSE CERTAINLY THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT INFORMATION TO GO THROUGH
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0083670_0084259 SO UM I'M THINKING HERE ABOUT UH PRIMARILY ABOUT CUSTOMER NEEDS THAT WE START WITH THE CUSTOMER
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0084259_0084832 AND W YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND WHAT ARE ISSUES WITH WITH UM EXISTING PRODUCTS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0084832_0085544 UH TO THINK ABOUT TRENDS AND ALSO ABOUT TRY AND CONNECT THAT AS YOU SEE WITH THE COMPANY VISION WHICH IS ABOUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0085544_0086084 UM AND THEN AS I SAY UH W WE'D LIKE TO PRIORITISE OUR DESIGN FEATURES FROM THIS AND UM
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0086384_0086446 DUNNO

AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0086636_0087259 SO THIS IS WHAT I'VE FOUND HERE UM A LOT OF THIS IS NEW TO ME SO WE'LL JUST READ THROUGH TOGETHER
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0087259_0087737 UM USERS DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0087737_0087877 SO THEY FIND THEM UGLY
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0087877_0088054 MOST PEOPLE FIND THEM UGLY
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0088054_0088618 UM THE VAST MAJORITY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY FOR IT TO LOOK FANCY AS WELL WE'LL SEE LATER
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0088618_0089306 THE VAST MAJORITY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY FOR UM SLIGHTLY MORE INTUITIVE CONTROL SUCH AS VOICE RECOGNITION
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0089306_0089547 OKAY I'M GONNA WE'LL LOOK AT THAT IN A SECOND
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0089547_0090087 UM MOST PEOPLE USE ONLY A F A VERY SLIM PORTION OF ALL THE CONTROLS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0090087_0090500 SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS PEOPLE WANT THIS H TECHNOLOGY
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0090500_0091204 THEY TEND TO USE THE MOST SIMPLE CONTROLS AND OVERALL THEY FIND REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE SOMETHING THEY DON'T DOESN'T REALLY APPEAL TO THEM
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0091257_0091971 SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE LIKE IF FOR ME THIS IS SORTA LIKE THREE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM INSPIRATIONS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0091971_0092409 YOU KNOW ONE IS THAT WE WANT UH SOMETHING THAT'S HIGH TECH BUT WE WANT IT TO SEEM EASY
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0092409_0093196 AND IN SPITE OF THE PRIMITIVE SIDE OF IT AND THE VERY HIGH TECH SIDE WE WANT IT TO JUST BE AN APPEALING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN PEOPLE'S HANDS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0093196_0093564 UM FRUSTRATIONS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0093564_0093847 THEY GET LOST A LOT S AS IT CAME UP IN OUR LAST MEETING
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0093847_0094155 UM TAKES TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE THEM
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0094155_0094666 THIS IS UH WHY I MENTION WHEN CRAIG WAS UH SHOWING US SOME IDEAS THAT WE ACTUALLY TRY AND GROUP CONTROLS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0094666_0095052 SO D IT DOESN'T JUST LOOK LIKE A BIG PANEL KINDA LIKE WHEN YOU YOU LOOK AT
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0095052_0095379 YOU KNOW A NEW COMPUTER KEYBOARD OR SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE EXPLANATORY
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0095379_0095745 IF YOU WANT AUDIO IF YOU WANT VISUAL THEN YOU HAVE THOSE
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0095745_0095804 UM
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0096018_0096281 AND I WILL ADMIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT R. S. I. STANDS FOR
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0096796_0097098 UH NO THAT DID NOT COME UP AT ALL
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0097098_0097717 UM SO HERE HERE IS ANOTHER UM SORT OF A A REVIEW HERE OF THE MAIN THINGS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0097717_0098254 I ALSO FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD UH ADULTS AT LEAST WOULD PAY MORE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0098254_0098719 NOW APPARENTLY WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE TECH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY IN REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0098719_0099134 SO I DUNNO IF THAT'S POSSIBLE WE MIGHT CONSIDER GETTING INTO IT

AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0099326_0100091 AND AND AGAIN HERE AS WE SORT OF MOVE M SORT OF THIN START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WANNA SELL AND MARKET THIS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0100091_0100740 I THINK A RECURRING THEME HERE IS THE COMPANY WANTS IT TO BE WANTS US TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S FASHIONABLE AND SLEEK AND TRENDY
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0100740_0101294 UM PEOPLE UH ADDITIONALLY AREN'T AREN'T LIKING THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR PRODUCTS
AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0101294_0102144 SO WE WANNA THINK ABOUT AS WE TAKE ALL THE SORT OF THE TECHIE FEATURES HOW WE CAN UM PUT THAT INTO A UNIT WHICH IS WHICH PEOPLE LIKE

AMI_ES2002b_H03_MEE008_0104182_0104875 SO IF WE DO SAY WELL WE WANT THERE TO BE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WILL WE TRY AND MAKE THAT ALMOST BE LIKE OPTIONAL TECHNOLOGY

AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0095791_0096321 OKAY UM I GUESS THE SAME THING AGAIN I STARTED WITH SOMETHING VERY BASIC
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0096321_0096666 SO JUST SO YOU GUYS HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT'S INVOLVED IN MY PROCESS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0096666_0097312 UM AND THEN YOU CAN JUST WORK THROUGH IT AND WE 'LL EITHER MODIFY IT OR START FROM SCRATCH UM DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0097368_0097621 UM THE COMPONENTS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0097621_0098176 UM I THINK LIKE WHAT YOU GUYS SAID UM THE MOST INPUT THAT'S NEEDED IS BASICALLY IN THE USER INTERFACE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0098176_0098714 THE REST OF THE COMPONENTS UM THEY DO HAVE AN IMPACT IN TERMS OF COST AND COMPLEXITY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0098714_0099196 UM LIKE YOU SAID TIME TO MARKET WAS A PROBLEM UM AND HOW MANY COMPONENTS ARE PHYSICALLY IN THERE IN COST
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0099223_0099438 AND THE POWER IS BASICALLY A FACTOR OF THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0099438_0100261 UM AND THE LOWER COMPONENTS THE POWER THE LOGIC THE TRANSMITTER AND THE INFRARED UM THEY AFFECT YOU IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF YOUR DEVICE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0100261_0101432 UM AND THAT WOULD HAVE SOME INTE IMPACT ON HOW Y I THINK MORE HOW YOU HOLD RATHER THAN UM THE ACTUAL USE USING THE THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE UM LIKE WE'VE SAID WE'VE DEFINED
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0101432_0101752 LIKE WE ONLY WANT THE BASIC THINGS THAT TO BE VISIBLE AND THE REST OF THEM WE TRY TO HIDE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0101793_0102144 SO UM YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WORKING OUT SPACE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0102144_0102691 SO I GUESS THREE THINGS UM COST UM COMPLEXITY AND THE SIZE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0102691_0102976 THESE ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT UM WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOU
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0102976_0103189 SO JUST GO THROUGH IT IN THE COMPONENTS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0103189_0103485 UM THESE ARE THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0103485_0104129 UM I'M NOT VERY SURE ABOUT THE VOICE THING 'CAUSE I GOT ANOTHER EMAIL AND IT WAS IN FACT QUITE SKETCHY ON WHAT N THE VOICE OPTIONS ARE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0104173_0104563 UM IT SAID IT COULD TALK TO YOU BUT IT NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LISTEN
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0104563_0104861 I IT SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A SENSOR BUT NEVER CLARIFIED THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0104861_0105246 SO MAYBE IF YOU WELL I COULD SEE THE OTHER EMAIL THAT THEY SENT YOU
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0105246_0105845 UM 'CAUSE THEY GOT BACK TO ME WITH LIKE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS OR DIFFERENT OFFERINGS OF WHAT COMPONENTS AVAILA
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0105851_0106416 OKAY SO YOUR BASIC COMPONENTS ARE BUTTONS OKAY AND YOU HAVE A WHEEL AVAILABLE LIKE A MOUSE SCROLL WHEEL
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0106416_0106869 OKAY THERE'S AN L. C. D. DISPLAY UM I THINK THESE ARE QUITE STANDARD THINGS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0107014_0107388 NO UM THEY'RE WELL IN THE SENSE THAT THESE ARE ALL THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR YOU
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0107388_0107745 I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU THE COMPLEXITY AND THE COST THING AGAIN A BIT LATER
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0107745_0108115 OKAY UM THEN THERE'S UM HOW THE CASE ACTUALLY LOOKS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0108115_0108415 IT CAN ACTUALLY BE FLAT OR IT CAN BE CURVED
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0108415_0108934 UM AND THEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIALS THAT YOU CAN USE UM I DON'T THINK YOU CAN USE THEM IN A COMBINATION
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0109069_0109543 UM BUT UM I COULD CHECK BACK FOR YOU BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THEM IN A COMBINATION
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0109783_0110472 UM I THINK PLASTIC AND RUBBER WOULD BE FINE BUT PLASTIC RUBBER AND WOOD I WASN'T I'M NOT VERY SURE ABOUT THE TITANIUM
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0110472_0110760 THEY HAD SOME RESTRICTIONS ON USING THE RUBBER AND THE TITANIUM
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0110760_0111124 UM THE RUBBER WAS A RESTRICTION ON THE KIND OF POWER SOURCE YOU COULD USE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0111124_0111909 BUT THE TITANIUM HAD A DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS ON THE SHAPE OF THE THING SO I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME RESTRICTION ON UM
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0111920_0112339 I THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY GROUP PLASTIC AND RUBBER TOGETHER WOOD AND TITANIUM
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0112339_0112828 BUT YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE EASIER FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE AND A COMPLEXITY JUST TO USE ONE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0112828_0112996 YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO TWO
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0112996_0113617 UM AND THE OTHER COMPONENTS ARE LOGIC CHIPS UM AGAIN I'LL I'LL GO BACK TO THE COMPONENT CHIPS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0113617_0114135 THE COM HOW COMPLEX OR HOW EASY THE LOGIC IS IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY FUNCTIONS YOU HAVE ON THE ON THE UNIT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0114163_0114358 UM AND THAT IMPACTS COST
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0114358_0114743 UM I DON'T THINK THE LOGIC CHIP HAS A ISSUE ABOUT SIZE 'CAUSE THEY SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0114743_0114972 POWER CONSUMPTION SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0114972_0115683 UM I THINK THE MAIN IMPACT IS COMPLEXITY UM AND THE OTHER THING IS UM THE POWER OPTIONS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0115683_0115901 UM THE FIRST ONE IS A STANDARD BATTERY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0115901_0116952 OKAY THE SECOND ONE I THINK IS MORE OF A GIMMICK THEN ACTUALLY A USEABLE THING IT'S A WIND UP YOU KNOW A CRANK
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0116952_0117899 YEAH BUT THAT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A LOOK AND FEEL DECISION BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE ONE POWER SOURCE IF YOU'RE USING THE ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0117941_0118452 I THINK WHATEVER IT IS YOU STILL NEED A BATTERY 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO KEEP DOING ONE THING
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0118452_0118706 OKAY THE OTHER ONES ARE A SOLAR POWERED CELL
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0118706_0119302 WHICH MAY NOT BE A GREAT IDEA IN EUROPE OR ANY COUNTRY THAT HAS SEASONS 'CAUSE HALF THE YEAR YOU'D BE DEAD
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0119325_0119688 SO LIKE WHAT I SAID YOU PROBABLY NEED LIKE A BATTERY AND SOMETHING ELSE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0119688_0120568 UM AND THE KINETIC ONE I GUESS FOR ME IS THE MOST INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE IT'S MOVEMENT AND PEOPLE LIKE TO FIDDLE WITH THEIR AND IT'S A NICE SALES GIMMICK I THINK
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0120568_0121178 FROM A MARKETING GIMMICK IT IT'S A TECHNOLOGY THING IT'S A SHAKE IT IT DOESN'T WORK SHAKE IT KNOCK IT OR SOMETHING
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0121178_0121911 YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOU HAD THOSE BALLS YOU KNOW THOSE STRESS BALLS WHERE YOU BOUNCE THE BALL AND IT AND IT LIGHTS UP AND IT GOES
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0121911_0122221 YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A GIMMICK COMBINED WITH RUBBER
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0122258_0123124 YOU KNOW JUST TO IF YOU GET FRUSTRATED WI REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN THROW IT KIND OF YOU KNOW JUST UH YOU KNOW UM SO
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0123124_0124038 UM OKAY MY FROM MY ROLE I DON'T THINK THAT PERSONAL PREFERENCES BUT ROLE PREFERENCES I THINK UM SOMETHING COMFORTABLE TO HOLD
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0124038_0124766 UM SMALL AND SLIM I GUESS THAT'S MORE IN THE SENSE OF SMALL AND SLIM IN TERMS OF COMFORTABLE NOT SO SMALL YOU CAN'T
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0124766_0124936 YOU KNOW LIKE A PHONE OR SOMETHING TOO SMALL PHONE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0124978_0125916 UM AND THE OTHER THING IS FROM A PRODUCTION POINT OF VIEW UM THE LESS COMPONENTS WE USE AND THE SIMPLER THE COMPONENTS MEANS YOU REDUCE YOUR COST AND YOU INCREASE YOUR PROFIT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0125916_0126639 UM AND ALSO THE TIME TO MARKET AND THE COMPLEXITY OF DEVELOPING DESIGNING AND DEBUGGING IT UM SO
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0126639_0127094 UM OKAY LET ME JUST GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0127094_0127139 UM
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0127277_0127727 THE USER INTERFACE RESTRICTIONS BASICALLY MEANS THAT IF YOU USE MORE COMPLICATED FEATURES
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0127727_0128308 LIKE THE BUTTONS ARE STANDARD OKAY THE L. C. D. PANEL AND THE SCROLL WHEEL YOU NEED MORE COMPLICATED LOGIC
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0128308_0128917 UM THE CASE OKAY WITH A RUBBER CASE YOU CAN'T HAVE THE SOLAR PANELS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0128917_0130004 OKAY WITH THE TITANIUM CASE LET ME JUST CHECK THAT UM TITANIUM CASE CAN'T BE CURVED IT HAS TO BE SQUARE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0130064_0130508 OKAY UM THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON THE PLASTIC AND IT CAN'T BE CURVED ON THE WOOD
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0130508_0131381 SO THAT'S AGAIN I DON'T THINK YOU CAN USE THEM IN A COMBINATION UM ESPECIALLY THE TITANIUM I I SUSPECT THEY'RE VERY FIXED TO A PARTICULAR NEED
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0131381_0131849 SO UM MIXING THEM MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA UM YEP
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0131849_0131895 THAT'S IT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0133328_0134053 UM I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE THE L. C. D. PANEL REQUIRES POWER AND THE L. C. D. IS A FORM OF A LIGHT SO THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0136468_0136999 ARE YOU THINKING ARE YOU THINKING OF OF A LIGHT IN THE SENSE OF UM A LIGHT LIGHT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0136999_0137550 OR A LIGHT IN THE SENSE OF IT GLOWS KIND OF YOU KNOW FRANKENSTEIN IT'S ALIVE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0137904_0137939 OKAY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0138642_0138680 OKAY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0139138_0139172 OKAY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0140439_0141012 UM THAT'S WHY I THINK THE OPTION OF THE THE KINETIC THING WHICH BASICALLY MEANS AS LONG AS YOU SHAKE IT LIKE A WATCH LIKE AN AUTOMATIC WATCH
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0141156_0141513 UM IT'S PROBABLY SENSITIVE ENOUGH WHEN YOU FIDDLE IT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0141513_0141846 SO YOU COULD TRIGGER THAT TO A LIGHT LIKE I SAID THE BOUNCING BALL THING
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0141846_0142315 OR YOU COULD TRIGGER THAT TO USE THAT TO POWER THE LIGHT AS OPPOSED TO SO WHEN THEY PICK IT UP
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0142315_0142569 RIGHT AND THEN THAT THAT SORTA TRIGGERS THE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0142707_0142792 GLOWINGNESS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0150175_0150247 I THINK HE MADE THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0157871_0158286 IS THERE A PARTICULAR SHAPE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0158286_0158693 LIKE DOES MARKETING HAVE ANY RESEARCH ON DOES IT NEED TO BE LONG
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0158693_0158917 DOES IT NEED WITH A SQUARE THING WHA
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0159047_0159347 YEAH 'CAUSE THAT WILL N HELP NARROW DOWN THE CHOICE OF
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0159451_0159599 LIKE FRUIT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0159599_0159822 I'M THINKING FRUITS IN MY HEAD BUT THAT'S TACKY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0177329_0177499 DO WE NEED AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0177499_0177712 WHAT WHAT'S THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0177920_0178314 YEAH BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE USING IT WHAT WOULD WE WHAT WOULD WE ACHIEVE FROM IT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0178314_0178720 PUTTING IN LIGHTS IS CHEAP BUT PUTTING IN AN L. C. D. PANEL JUST TO MAKE IT GLOW IS A BIT OF A
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0179793_0179833 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0180220_0180715 I THINK THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN INPUT DEVICE TO GET THE LISTINGS INTO IT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0180715_0181230 SO UM IT'S A BIT NUTS TO GET THE MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY YOU KNOW
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0181349_0181927 UM I I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S NO NEED FOR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY BUT UM IT'S WHAT'S WHAT WHAT WOULD IT TELL THE USER
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0181927_0182882 'CAUSE THE L. C. D. TENDS TO BE AN OUTPUT AS UH AS OPPOSED TO AN INPUT SO UM DOES THE REMOTE CONTROL NEED TO TALK BACK TO THE USER
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0182882_0183179 WE HAVE THE OPTION OF THE SPEAKER AS WELL THE SA THE SAME THING GOES FOR THE SPEAKER
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0183179_0183647 IS THERE A NEED FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO TO TALK BACK
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0183801_0183904 UM
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0184450_0184847 YOU COULD PUT A GAME ON IT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0184847_0185233 WHEN THE T. V. DIES YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0188112_0188382 WHERE WOULD YOU PHYSICALLY POSITION THE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0188382_0188837 UM I THINK THAT THAT HAS SOME IMPACT ON ON ON MANY THINGS
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0188837_0189112 UM MAYBE YOU WANNA DRAW ONTO THE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0189639_0189669 YEP
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0193636_0194266 NO LIKE I SAID WE HAVE A H HYBRID KIND OF THING SO IT'S NOT GONNA CHARGE THE BATTERY IT'S JUST
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0194438_0194469 YEAH
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0196224_0196241 YEP
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0199195_0199280 YES YES
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0204264_0204448 OR EVEN A CLEAR CASE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0204448_0205546 UM YOU KNOW A A GLOWING A A GLOWING YELLOW TYPE CASE WHERE THE YELLOW IS SHOWABLE BUT IN THE DARK IT SORT OF IT'S ALIVE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0205546_0205746 UM IN IN A SLIGHT SUBTLE WAY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0205867_0205967 YEAH YEAH
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0206080_0206169 YEAH
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0206282_0206592 OR OR THERE MIGHT BE A LIGHT RUNNING THROUGH IT LIKE A MOUSE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0206592_0206867 YOU KNOW YOU HAVE CORDLESS MICE AND THEY DON'T EAT THAT MUCH POWER RIGHT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0206867_0207545 SO THE POWER THE BATTERY IN THAT SENSE MAYBE YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO STRATIG STRATEGICALLY PLACED LIGHTS THAT SORT OF
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0207705_0208316 YEAH BUT BECAUSE THE CASE IS TRANSPARENT SO IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT OF A GLOW DOESN'T MAKE IT FREAKY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0210557_0210817 THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU'RE ROLLING IT HOW DO YOU WANNA ROLL IT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0210817_0210950 DO YOU WANT 'EM TO ROLL IT LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0210950_0211105 DO YOU WANT 'EM TO ROLL IT LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0211105_0211538 'CAUSE IN A MOUSE YOUR HAND'S IN A POSITION TO ROLL IT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0211538_0212008 WHEREAS THE OTHER THING ABOUT HAVING IT JOG DIAL THIS WAY IT TENDS TO GET MOVED ACCIDENTALLY
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0212641_0213019 THAT'S A VERY UNNATURAL MOTION TO YEAH
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0213019_0213227 CAN YOU IMAGINE YOU HAVE TO SCROLL A LOT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0213227_0213864 UM IT MIGHT WORK FOR VOLUME AND MAYBE SOME OF THE BRIGHTNESS CONTROLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT NOT FOR CHANNELS RIGHT
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0213864_0214612 IF YOU HAVE A TELEWEST BOX YOU'VE GOT LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ALL THE CHANNELS YOU'VE ABOUT FIFTY CHANNELS CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0214612_0215229 UM AND I DON'T THINK HAVING THAT YOU KNOW TOO QUICK TOO SLOW KIN IT'S CONFUSING TO THE I DUNNO
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0215573_0216016 BUT USERS TEND TO TEND TO WANT TO USE THAT AND ONCE THEY LOSE OUT ON THE USER EXPERIENCE THEY'RE LIKE
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0216104_0216449 BECAUSE THAT'S BECOMES THE MOST ACCESSIBLE THING IN FRONT OF
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0216863_0216891 YEAH
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0222698_0222910 SO YOU WANNA EXPAND THE SHAPE OF THE

AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0227658_0228526 UM I THINK ONE THING WOULD BE THE JOG DIAL 'CAUSE THAT'S GONNA HAVE QUITE A BIG IMPACT ON THE THING UM
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0228685_0229136 YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING THE A SLIDE BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT THE HAND
AMI_ES2002c_H00_MEE006_0229136_0229315 I THINK INCORPORATING A LOGO IS QUITE STRAIGHT FORWARD

AMI_ES2002c_H01_FEE005_0233687_0234380 SO UM THAT'S REALLY GOOD LIKE WE'VE S HAD MUCH TO TALK ABOUT THAT UM PRETTY MUCH RUN OUT OF TIME TO DO SO
AMI_ES2002c_H01_FEE005_0234380_0234960 SO OFF YOU GO AND DESIGN STUFF WOOH
AMI_ES2002c_H01_FEE005_0235141_0235291 YEAH QUITE JEALOUS ACTUALLY
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0064072_0064119 IS IT WORKING
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0066493_0066649 AND SO THINK OF THIS CONCEPT
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0066845_0067243 UM TO RESEARCH IT I'VE UM HAD A LOOK ON THE THE HOMEPAGE AGAIN
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0067243_0067719 IT'S PROVIDED ME WITH MORE EXAMPLES OF UM PREVIOUSLY EXISTING C REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0067719_0068127 UM THERE'S A WEE BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OTHER EXISTING ONES THERE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0068127_0068737 UM SO I'VE TAKEN THE UM SUGGESTIONS FROM THEM AND TRIED TO INCORPORATE THEM INTO THIS UM
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0068879_0069426 SO THEN THIS WE'RE LOOKING FOR UM SUGGESTIONS ON SIZE TH UM SIZE OF CONTROL AND THE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0069426_0069893 UM THE SHAPE OF THE CONTROL AND WHEREABOUT THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE LOCATED ON THE CONTROL
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0070282_0070848 UM WHAT I FOUND FROM THE RESEARCH IS THAT MOST THE CURRENT CONTROLS ARE JUST BASICALLY BIG BRICKS WITH LOADS OF BUTTONS ALL OVER THEM
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0070961_0071343 UM THEY'RE NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT AND THEY'RE NOT VERY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0071343_0071688 THEY'RE I JUST HOLD 'EM LIKE BIG BRICKS AND THEY'RE VERY EASILY LOST
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0071688_0072184 UM THEY TEND TO BE VERY DARK COLOURS SO IF THERE ARE SHADOWY PLACES DOWN THE SIDE OF COUCHES YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0072282_0072898 UM THE THE CONTROLS THEMSELVES TEND TO USE A VERY INCONSISTENT COLOUR SCHEME
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0072898_0073305 UM FOR INSTANCE THE STAND BY BUTTON ISN'T ALWAYS RED UH IT REALLY SHOULD BE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0073305_0073568 IT'S UH SOMETHING THE USER THEN UH IDENTIFY WITH
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0073568_0073916 THIS IS A RED SWITCH OFF THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0073916_0074294 UM I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT BUT SOMETHING TO LOOK OUT FOR
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0074469_0075630 UM THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT I'VE I'VE GOT COUPLE OF PREFERENCES FOR THE THE END CONTROL UM I GET 'EM WITH THE THE RED COLOUR BUTTON FOR STAND BY AND S THE OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT UM
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0075712_0075851 THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE LARGE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0075851_0076091 THEY SHOULDN'T BE TINY LITTLE THINGS LIKE YOU GET ON SOME MOBILE PHONES
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0076091_0076294 THEY SHOULD BE EASY TO PRESS VERY COMFORTABLE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0076344_0077201 UM ONE OF THE EXAMPLES GIVEN ON THE HOMEPAGE WAS UM THERE'S AN UP AND DOWN VOLUME BUTTON BUT BOTH OF THEM HAVE A V. ON THEM
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0077201_0077628 SO THE UP VOLUME BUTTON LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD BE A DOWN VOLUME BUTTON THAT'S KINDA CONFUSING
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0077628_0077876 UM SHOULD AVOID S THINGS LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0077876_0078569 UM IF THE THE CORPORATE COLOUR SCHEME ALLOWS IT WE SHOULD HAVE A VERY BRIGHT COLOUR SO THAT IT CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED ANYWHERE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0078699_0079308 UM OBVIOUSLY TRYING TRYING TO AVOID BEING TACKY THERE BUT IT COULD UM TIE IN VERY EASILY WITH YOUR YOUR LIME AND LEMON IDEA
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0080145_0080333 FANTASTIC
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0080651_0080707 UM
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0080853_0081143 ANY EXTRA FEATURES WE ADD BEYOND THE BASIC ONES SHOULD BE M HIDDEN
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0081143_0081795 THEY SHOULDN'T BE ON THE UM SHOULDN'T BE VISIBLE WITHOUT SOMETHING BE OPENED OR SOME SORT OF SPECIAL EXTRA EFFORT
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0081795_0082289 UM IF WE DID DECIDE TO GO FOR VOICE ACTIVATION THERE SH SHOULD ALWAYS BE A BUTTON AS ALTERNATIVE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0082289_0082879 POSSIBLY HIDDEN IN THE THE OPENED UP SECTION UM MAKING THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH IT OR WITH SOMEBODY'S VOICE MAYBE THEY GOT A COLD OR
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0083001_0083387 UM WE SHOULD DEFINITELY AVOID THE BIG SQUARE BLOCK LOOK
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0083387_0083454 THAT'S JUST WRONG
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0083644_0084154 AND UM WE GOT AN EMAIL UH FROM I THINK IT'S THE THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0084154_0084597 AND THEY'VE SAID TH THE VOICE CONTROL UM CAN NOW TALK BACK IF YOU ASK IT A QUESTION
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0084597_0084898 SO IT SH IT COULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THEM UM CONFIRM ANY ACTION YOU TAKE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0084983_0085098 AND POSSIBILITY
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0085406_0085599 RIGHT AND THESE ARE PROBLEMS I'VE HAD WITH IT
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0085599_0085931 UM I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SLOGAN SHOULD GO OR REALLY WHAT THE SLOGAN IS
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0085931_0086226 I THINK IT'S UM FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0086226_0086414 AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW FLEXIBLE THE COLOUR SCHEME IS
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0086414_0086987 I MEAN YOU SAY YOU WANTED THE THE CORPORATE COLOURS BUT THEY DON'T SAY YOU KNOW IF WE CAN USE ANY OTHER COLOURS AT ALL OR
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0087407_0087444 THAT'S IT
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0089632_0089702 I THINK I'M COOL
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0104123_0104145 RIGHT
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0105892_0105910 RIGHT
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0146946_0147663 UM I THINK WE COULD GO FOR LIKE UM MAYBE NOT A P A FRUIT SHAPE BUT A VERY SORT OF CURVY TYPE SHAPE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0147663_0147909 UM YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME SORT OF TEXTURE AND COLOUR AS A FRUIT
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0148644_0148952 UM PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT S SITS IN YOUR HAND COMFORTABLY SORT OF FEELS RIGHT IN YOUR HAND
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0159602_0159665 SEE I'M
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0164802_0164989 I'D QUITE LIKE A SORT OF UH SNOWMAN TYPE SHAPE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0165124_0165701 UM SO A P SORT OF LARGER BIT SITS IN YOUR HAND AND THEN YOU GOT MAYBE ANOTHER BUBBLE AT THE TOP FOR JUST ANY OTHER FUNCTION YOU NEED
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0169079_0170035 UM SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM YOU GOT TWO GROUPS THERE UM MAYBE IT COULD FOLD UP AND YOU GET A THIRD GROUP INSIDE OR UH YOU HAVE VOLUME CONTROLS ABOUT THERE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0172272_0172543 SO I RECKON IT'D LOOK QUITE NICE IF WE JUST HAD UM THIS HERE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0172543_0172980 HAD A SORTA BACKGROUND YELLOW AND THEN HAVE SORT OF A NICE BOLD COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0174744_0174841 I THINK THAT MIGHT SCARE ME
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0175547_0175646 I THINK THAT'D PROBABLY SCARE ME
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0175646_0175883 YOU TURN IT ON YOUR CONTROL POSSESSED S
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0177280_0177334 UM
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0183616_0183665 NAH
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0186441_0186952 UM WELL I THINK THE ADVANCED ONES THE THE ONES YOU DON'T USUALLY USE COULD BE HID INSIDE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0186952_0187406 B UM I THINK THE WE HAD WERE FAIRLY BASIC ONES THEY'D HAVE TO GO ON THE THE FRONT SOMEWHERE
AMI_ES2002c_H02_MEE007_0188793_0188844 UM

AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0000695_0001362 IT KINDA DOES MAKE SENSE DOESN'T IT BECAUSE WHEN WE GET INTO THE END OF MEETING WE'RE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT ACTION AND DESIGN AS OPPOSED TO BACKGROUND
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0001362_0001512 EVERYTHING I HAVE IS KINDA BACKGROUND
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0003409_0003449 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0006372_0006522 UH THAT SOUNDS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0007531_0007583 SURE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0007719_0007753 OKAY
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0008311_0008355 SURE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0008919_0009054 YEAH COOL
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0009157_0009310 WHY DON'T I GET THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0009454_0009472 HMM
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0012542_0012633 OKAY
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0013204_0013266 OKAY
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0013429_0013744 UM ALRIGHT SO C IS IT FUNCTION F. EIGHT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0014086_0014125 HMM
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0014455_0014647 COME ON
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0014647_0014725 I THINK IT'S WORKING
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0014857_0015238 OKAY GREAT S SO LET ME JUST START THIS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0015663_0015759 OKAY GREAT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0015759_0016033 SO UM UH S MOVE ON
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0016163_0016529 UH-HUH OH WHERE'D IT ALL GO
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0016529_0016673 IT'S NOT GOOD
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0016673_0017008 OKAY LEMME JUST SEE WHERE I CAN FIND IT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0017959_0018079 THIS LOOKS MORE LIKE IT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0018246_0018396 I THINK I JUST OPENED UP THE TEMPLATE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0018396_0018476 SORRY ABOUT THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0018476_0018686 OKAY ALRIGHT SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK HERE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0018686_0018944 OKAY SO THIS WAS THE METHOD THAT UM I'VE TAKEN
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0018944_0019240 UH BASICALLY WHAT I WANNA DO HERE BEFORE WE GET INTO IT UH TOO FAR
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0019240_0019837 IS I WANT TO SHOW YOU ALL THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION I HAVE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IF WE WANT THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0019916_0020326 AND UH AND THEN SORTA G GO THROUGH SOME OF THE WAY THAT I'VE DEALT WITH THAT INFORMATION
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0020326_0020854 AND THEN SORT OF BRING US ALL TOGETHER INTO IT TO SEE SORTA SEE HOW THIS FITS IN WITH THE OVERALL VISION
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0020914_0021505 UM SO I'VE TRIED TO TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MARKET RESEARCH AND SUMMARISE IT FOR US
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0021505_0022323 AND THEN IDE IDENTIFY UH TRENDS THAT ARE ARE SORT OF IN SYNC AND ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR OUR UH P PROJECT PLAN THAT WE HAVE SO FAR
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0022323_0023428 AND THEN UH INITIATE A KIND OF DISCUSSION ON DESIGN OPTIONS SO THAT IT SORTA HELPS US TO TO NARROW IN ON ON ASPECTS THAT WILL INFORM OTHER UH OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE PROJECT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0023472_0023695 DOES THAT MAKE SENSE THA THAT SORT OF STRATEGY
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0023695_0024137 I THOUGHT THAT THAT WILL IMPACT ON THE REST OF WHAT WE DO SO THAT'S WHY I SUGGESTED WE GET IN THIS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0024137_0024667 OKAY SO OUT OF UM DIFFERENT UH FIGURES AND RATINGS OB UH OF PEOPLE IN GENERAL
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0024667_0025278 UM CONSUMERS IN GENERAL THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WAS FOUND WAS THAT UH THE BR T TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0025278_0026072 A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL OKAY AND NOT IT SPECIFIED NOT A FUNCTIONAL LOOK OR OR FEEL UH B F F FANCY
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0026111_0026548 UM HOWEVER THIS IS WHERE WE KINDA HAVE TO BE VERY I THINK CREATIVE ABOUT IT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0026548_0026802 NUMBER TWO WAS THAT IT BE INNOVATIVE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0026802_0027658 OKAY SO THAT TELLS ME THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO BE INNOVATIVE WITHOUT A ADDING JUST UNNECESSARY UM SORT OF FUNCTIONAL BITS TO IT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0027658_0028423 UH AND THIRD PRIORITY UH FOR EASE OF USE SO AGAIN THAT KIND OF GIVES US A GENERAL PICTURE OF HOW IT HAS TO BE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0028423_0028819 UM QUITE USER FRIENDLY WHILE STILL HAVING TECHNOLOGY
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0028835_0029364 SO IT I'LL JUST SAY RIGHT AWAY AS A BIT OF A FORESHADOWING INTO HOW WE PROCEED WITH THIS IN TERMS OF M MARKETING
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0029364_0029783 IS THAT I THINK UM WHAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS HOW THE UM
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0029886_0030745 ABOUT HOW THE INNOVATION UH CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOOK AND FEEL AND NOT SO MUCH TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0030745_0031224 FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WHEN YOU PICK IT UP AND PUSH IT LIKE IT ALL LIGHTS UP OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0031224_0031936 OR IT'S GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO IT THAT JUST SEEMS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE THING THAT THE MESSAGE HERE IS EASE OF USE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0031936_0032350 SO HOW DO YOU MAKE INNOVATION MAKE SOMETHING MORE MORE EASY TO USE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0032350_0032582 WELL THAT'S I GUESS WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0032582_0033025 OKAY THEN THERE'S THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE BACK THE THE MARKET UM
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0033135_0033589 RESEARCH I HAVE HERE IS ON FASHION STYLE OKAY WHICH AS WE'VE AGREED IS A PRIORITY
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0033589_0034653 UH TOP EUROPEAN FASHION TREND UM THAT I READ ABOUT SAYS THERE'S THIS EMERGING THEME OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES OKAY ESPECIALLY IN CLOTHES AND FURNITURE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0034653_0035292 AND WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT I THOUGHT HMM WELL DO WE WANT TO ACTUALLY TRY AND THINK ABOUT THIS TREND AND HOW WE ADD SOMETHING TO IT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0035292_0035615 OR WE GET RIGHT INTO IT OR WE COMPLETELY STEER AWAY FROM IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0035672_0036007 SO MY MY FEELING IS THAT WE W DO WANT TO OBSERVE THIS TREND
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0036007_0036834 BUT WE WANT TO THINK ALSO ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT SORT OF HAS TO FIT IN WITH SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT SPECIFICALLY ELECTRONICS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0036834_0037496 UM 'CAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE IN WHAT WE'RE IN IS PARTLY SORT OF HOME DECOR PARTLY SOMETHING LIKE A COMPUTER
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0037496_0038127 UM SO I THINK WE MIGHT WANNA BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW HOW QUICKLY WE CREATE LIKE A REMOTE CONTROL IN THE SHAPE OF AN APPLE OR SOMETHING
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0038127_0038242 I THINK THAT WOULD BE PUSHING IT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0038317_0039066 AND THEN IN TERMS OF M MATERIAL TRENDS ARE FOR THINGS TO BE SOFT AND SPONGY AND SORT OF YOU MIGHT SAY ERGONOMIC OR OR FRIENDLY TO HANDLE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0039066_0039539 WHICH IS WHICH ALSO IN INDICATED THAT LAST YEAR THIS WAS THIS WAS NOT THE CASE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0039539_0040186 SO UM PROBABLY A LOT OF THE COMPETITION ON THE MARKET WILL BE STILL IN LAST YEAR'S MODE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0040186_0040619 SO IF WE TRY AND REALLY CAPITALISE ON THAT I THINK THAT'LL BE IN OUR FAVOUR
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0040619_0040696 UM
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0040960_0041146 SO THESE THIS IS THE SUMMARY OF EVERYTHING
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0041146_0041677 UM STYLE IS NUMBER ONE UH THING IN THE IN THE MARKET OF WHO WE'RE SELLING TO
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0041677_0042319 UH INNOVATIVE DESIGN TECHNOLOGY'S ALSO A MUST IN THAT IT'S SEEN IT'D BE SEEN TO BE UH CUTTING EDGE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0042319_0042548 UH BUT EASE OF USE T HAS TO BE INSURED THROUGHOUT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0042548_0042725 THAT WAS LIKE THE NUMBER THREE THING
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0042725_0043091 AND THEN AT THE END THERE ARE VIBRANT NATURAL COLOURS UM
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0043205_0043656 THAT'S THE WAY I INTERPRETED IT ANYWAY SOFTNESS IN MATERIALS SHAPE AND FUNCTION
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0043656_0044040 AND SO I'VE WRITTEN AT WRITTEN AT THE BOTTOM TO GIVE US SORT OF A CONTEXT OF DISCUSSION
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0044040_0044572 MAC IPODS SOMETHING WHICH IS I'D HAVE TO SAY VERY HIGH TECH
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0044572_0044943 TEN GIGABYTES WHATEVER BUT WHEN YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND THERE'S LIKE NO BUTTONS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0044943_0045057 YOU KNOW WHAT A MAC IPOD IS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0045104_0045647 I'M THINKING HOWEVER MAC IPOD IS SORT OF LAST YEAR'S BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD AND SORT OF GLASSY AND GLOSSY
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0045647_0046667 SO I'M THINKING IF WE IMAGINE THAT WE'RE TAKING SOME OF THE FEATURES OF A MAC IPOD AND WE'RE THEN MAKING IT S MORE OF LIKE A MORE OF LIKE A COMFORTABLE TYPE OF OR MORE OF LIKE A
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0046753_0047048 MAYBE MORE VIBRANT TO FRIENDLY THING TO HAVE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0047160_0047943 UM AND THEN SO THIS IS W WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION WHAT I'M WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IN THIS SLIDE HERE IS THAT WE WE TAKE THESE IDEAS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0047943_0048554 AND AS WE GET INTO MORE THE MORE UM TECHNI LIKE SORT OF PRODUCTION SIDE OF THINGS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0048554_0049114 THAT WE THINK ABOUT SHAPE MATERIALS AND THEMES OR SERIES THAT GO THROUGHOUT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0049114_0049217 SORT OF LIKE A
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0049404_0050149 I DUNNO LIKE UM WE THINK OF SOME KIND OF A THIN THEME THAT UNIFIES IT ALL THAT WE AGREE ON UH SORTA LIKE A MARKETING IDENTITY
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0050149_0050228 UM
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0050375_0050474 DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0050474_0050570 YEAH
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0050570_0051131 SO SO LIKE I THREW OUT A FEW IDEAS THERE JUST TO KINDA GET US THINKING ALONG THOSE LINES LIKE LEMON
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0051131_0051528 LIME I DUNNO GREEN COLOURS PE WHATEVER IT'S JUST AN IDEA
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0051528_0052269 'CAUSE I'M THINKING THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS WILL SEEM QUITE COHERENT IF WE USE THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR WHAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THIS THEM WITH IN TERMS OF TEXTURE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0052269_0052497 SHAPE COLOURS THINGS LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0052687_0053503 LIKE UM THE ONES THE ONES WHICH I'M MOST FOND OF IN TERMS OF GIVING LIKE A THEME TO IT WOULD BE LIKE UM LIKE LEMON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0053503_0054016 YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHICH IS LIKE YOU SEE A LOT IN IN OTHER AREAS
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0054016_0054535 LIKE I SEE LOTS OF WEBSITES AND THINGS THAT SEEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH LIKE LEMON AND LIME AND
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0054595_0054791 SO ANYWAY IT'S JUST JUST AN IDEA
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0054907_0056249 I'M THINKING MAYBE WE COULD INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE FEATURES INTO A FAIRLY UM INTO SOMETHING WHICH IS WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO IT WHICH IS ALMOST GIMMICKY BECAUSE LIKE UM LIKE SOMETHING TO DO WITH LIKE LIGHTING WITHIN IT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0056249_0057041 LIKE YOU KNOW JUST WITHIN THE SIMPLE SENSE WHEN YOU PICK UP A PHONE AND TOUCH A BUTTON IT UH LIGHTS UP Q USUALLY THE BUTTONS LIGHT UP
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0057041_0057155 HOW CAN WE BUILD ON THAT
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0057155_0057830 MAYBE LIKE IT COULD LIGHT UP IN DIFFERENT COLOURS OR SOMETHING OR OR PEOPLE COULD BUY THE BUY THE CONTROL AND THEN IT COMES WITH DIFFERENT LIKE
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0057996_0058138 COVERS OR SOMETHING SO
AMI_ES2002c_H03_MEE008_0058138_0058718 ANYWAY THOSE ARE THAT'S ALL I HAVE BUT UH HOPEFULLY WE CAN WE CAN REVISIT THOSE IDEAS WHEN WE GET INTO

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0047828_0047928 IT'S ONE SPECIAL COLOUR
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0048056_0048312 'CAUSE THE CASE UNIT ITSELF THE REST OF OUR COMPONENTS GO ON TOP OF IT
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0048565_0048608 YES

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0052882_0053214 'CAUSE THAT'S ONE BUTTON BY ITS THE COMPLEXITY OF TWELVE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0053409_0053665 SO WE'RE JUST ESTIMATING THAT YEAH IT WOULD BE LESS

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0058278_0058942 THE OTHER THING COULD BE THAT UM YOU COULD TAKE AWAY THE L. C. D. PANEL AND THE ADVANCED CHIP TOGETHER UM BECAUSE WHEN YOU
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0059086_0059457 DO SOMETHING ON THE T. V. THE T. V. RESPONDS AND REACTS AS WELL
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0059457_0060329 SO THE USER COULD BE LOOKING AT THE T. V. AND PUSHING HIS THING SO WE MAY NOT NEED TO SO WHEN WE SCROLL WE NEED JUST SOME WAY TO GET THE T. V. TO RESPOND
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0060329_0060550 WHICH I THINK IS A TECHNICALLY DOABLE THING SO
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0061050_0061069 YEP
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0061269_0061430 AND THE ADVANCED CHIP GOES AWAY AS WELL
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0061660_0061710 REGULAR CHIP

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0062212_0062421 SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT UM
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0063176_0063474 THE TWELVE BUTTONS THAT YOU SEE THERE
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0063820_0064144 FUNCTIONALLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO INTERCEPT SO FOUR IS A GOOD ESTIMATE FOR
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0064298_0064892 YEAH SO YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY CUT IT'S LIKE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS FOUR EIGHT TWELVE
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0065307_0065859 IT IT NEEDS TO BE MORE THAN ONE BIG BUTTON BECAUSE IF YOU OPEN UP YOUR PHONE
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0065859_0066349 UNDERNEATH THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE BUTTON UNDERNEATH IT'S JUST THAT THE PANEL ITSELF IS A SINGLE PANEL
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0066808_0067457 WE JUST REPORT THAT IT HAS TO BE OVER BUDGET OR THE COLOURS YOU COULD TAKE AWAY S COLOURS FOR TH FOR THE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0067645_0067776 NORMAL COLOURED BUTTONS
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0068220_0068362 NO THAT'S NOT THE BUTTON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0068362_0068608 THAT'S THE BUTTONS ONLY REFER TO THE PAD SO
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0068813_0068979 SHOULD WE TAKE THAT OFF UH
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0069239_0069455 HEY IT'S BACK TO THE ORIGINAL
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0069455_0070016 UM SO THEN THESE JUST BECOME NORMAL COLOURED BUTTONS SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME SOME WAY OF CUTTING THE COST
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0072436_0072462 YEAH
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0076226_0076345 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PROFILE

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0077242_0077642 WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PLAY DOH TO MAKE IT THREE D.
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0077791_0078118 SO THERE'S ONE MORE DIMENSION TO THE THING WHICH WE NEED TO TO ADD
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0078118_0078350 AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD IN THE REPORT LENGTH WIDTH AND HEIGHT
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0078524_0078544 YEAH
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0079236_0079262 YEAH

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0080938_0081086 THIS IS ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT TWO
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0081292_0081445 SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TWO SO
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0081692_0081740 OKAY
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0086632_0087307 I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY HARD TO CATCH SO YOU YOU RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WANNA TRY SOMETHING
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0087307_0087590 THE THE LOOK AND THE COLOUR IS SOMETHING WHICH IS COOL
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0087590_0088231 BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO THAT FACTOR OF IF IT'S TOO UNFAMILIAR THEN UM BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SHELF
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0088333_0088852 YEAH BUTTON SHAPE MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO CHANGE RATHER THAN RATHER THAN POSITIONING
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0088852_0089352 'CAUSE I THINK POSITIONING IS WE'RE KINDA ENGRAINED INTO THE THE TELEPHONE KIND OF

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0093213_0093447 MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THE DESIGN EVALUATION FIRST

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0159628_0160620 I THINK ANOTHER POINT IS THAT THE MEETINGS UM ARE MORE BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS THAN MEETINGS SO TIME IS ALSO A VERY S UM STRONG FACTOR AND STRUCTURE
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0160620_0161225 BECAUSE FOR A BRAINSTORMING MEETING YOU WANT A STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ALLOWS IDEAS TO GET TOSSED

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0173870_0174590 I THINK STRUCTURE IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL IS STRUCTURED TO ONE PARTICULAR TASK AND ONE PARTI RATHER THAN CONTROLLING
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0174590_0174977 I DON'T THINK THERE'S A SENSE OF CONTROL 'CAUSE ALL THE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF A
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0174977_0175221 LIKE A CONSENSUS RIGHT WE GO AROUND AND WE THINK ABOUT IT
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0175221_0175761 BUT THAT YOU KNOW PROCESS ACTUALLY SAYS YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN A CERTAIN WAY
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0175761_0176395 IT DOESN'T TELL YOU YOU KNOW SOME WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA BE A BIT MORE CREATIVE IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS YOU KNOW NOT THE
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0178191_0178662 I THINK YOU TRIED TO USE THE COMMON SHARE FOLDER TO TO TO TO COMMUNICATE

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0181399_0182036 I THINK THE TOOLS THAT THEY WERE GIVEN THE TOOL SET THAT WERE GIVEN TO US ARE FANCY BUT THEY DON'T SUPPORT COLLABORATION I THINK THAT'S THE WORD
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0182036_0182508 THEY DON'T SUPPORT THE TEAM WORKING TOGETHER YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL VERY INDIVIDUAL TOOLS
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0185051_0185226 WE HAD PLAY DOH FUN

AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0197211_0197725 I THINK UM THE THE FOCUS OF IT A LOT WAS THE POWERPOINT AS OPPOSED TO THE TO THE WHITEBOARD
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0197725_0198276 AND I THINK THAT M UM IS ALSO DOES YOU KNOW HINDER US AND THINGS I THINK
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0198276_0198785 IT WILL BE COOLER TO HAVE THE WHITEBOARD RATHER THAN THE THE POWERPOINT
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0198785_0199253 OR MAYBE THE WHITEBOARD AND THE POWERPOINT IN THE SAME PLACE YOU KNOW IN THE CENTRE OF THE
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0201138_0201432 I THINK THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY POWERPOINTS IN THE MEETINGS
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0201432_0201698 'CAUSE THE PLUG IN AND THE PLUGGING SPENT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOING THAT
AMI_ES2002d_H00_MEE006_0201698_0202255 AND A LOT OF THE INFORMATION ON THE POWERPOINTS I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WE NEEDED TO ACTUALLY IT COULD HAVE

AMI_ES2003a_H02_MEE012_0090330_0090484 SO PERHAPS ONE THAT WAS MORE UM
AMI_ES2003a_H02_MEE012_0090644_0091000 SPECIALISED FOR GAME PLAYING OR INTERACTIVE TELEVISION
AMI_ES2003a_H02_MEE012_0091000_0091764 THEY THEY'VE RECENTLY BROUGHT OUT THIS NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR PEOPLE TO SET THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNELS OR UM TO RECORD THINGS
AMI_ES2003a_H02_MEE012_0091764_0092095 INSTEAD OF PEOPLE ENTERING IN WHAT TIME THINGS START
AMI_ES2003a_H02_MEE012_0092095_0092777 YOU SIMPLY STRI SLIDE A BAR TO SAY WHAT TIME IT BEGINS AND SLIDE ANOTHER BAR TO SAY WHAT TIME IT ENDS YOU KNOW THAT'S
AMI_ES2003a_H02_MEE012_0093048_0093241 YEAH IT'S IT'S TAKEN OUT THE
AMI_ES2003a_H02_MEE012_0093387_0093779 Y YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE UH REALLY CLEVER TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003a_H02_MEE012_0093779_0094258 I THINK FOR GAMING YOU KNOW YOU WANT YOU WANT SOME BIG BUTTONS FOR UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT SHOOT
AMI_ES2003a_H02_MEE012_0094445_0095237 UH YOU WANNA BE ABLE TO CHANGE ANGLES IN INTERACTIVE TELEVISION SO YOU NEED BUTTONS TO CHANGE THE TELEVISION ANGLE THE CAMERA ANGLES AND STUFF LIKE THAT

AMI_ES2003a_H03_MEE010_0101016_0101555 LIKE UH CONTROL PADS YOU KNOW OF GAMES BUT OR IS THAT A BIT RIDICULOUS
AMI_ES2003a_H03_MEE010_0102616_0102651 YEAH

AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0055736_0056251 OKAY THIS IS A BRIEF RUN THROUGH OF THE UM OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0056251_0057541 AS UM IS UH THE THE THE PRESENTATION IS UH ALREADY SLIGHTLY OBSOLETE BECAUSE I HAD IN MIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD UH BE I BE AIMED AT CONTROLLING MULTIPLE DEVICES BUT UH THERE'S STILL STUFF OF RELEVANCE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0057541_0057565 SO
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0057695_0057798 PRESS ON
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0057798_0058771 I'VE LOOKED AT LOOKED AT A NUM UH COUPLE OF OTHER UH REMOTE CONTROL MODELS JUST FOR AN IDEA OF BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0058771_0058817 UM
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0058957_0059800 AND WASN'T REALLY SATISFIED BY WHAT I SAW I HAVE TO SAY SO THIS IS MORE SORT OF SPRINGBOARD FOR UH HOW THESE COULD BE IMPROVED ON
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0059912_0060711 UM UM BASICALLY THE JOB OF THE DEVICE IS TO SEND COMMANDS TO AN APPLIANCE IN THIS CASE THE TELEVISION SET
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0060711_0061054 UM TO SAVE YOU GETTING OFF YOUR BACKSIDE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0061054_0061651 UM AND THERE'S TWO MAIN TRENDS IN TH IN THE SORT OF DESIGN PRACTICE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0061651_0062748 ON THE ONE HAND AND THIS UH THIS PARTICULARLY RELATES TO ITS SORT OF EARLIEST MODELS WHERE WITH YOU KNOW I SO SO MANY BUTTONS ON IT SO ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE TELEVISION SET
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0062748_0063483 UM GIVING YOU EVERY POSSIBLE FUNCTION THAT THE THAT THE DEVICE HAS THE REMOTE CONTROL CONTROLS
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0063483_0064241 AND MOST OF THESE FUNCTIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE USED IT CREATES A RATHER USER UNFRIENDLY INTERFACE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0064241_0064974 AND ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A USER FOCUSED APPROACH THAT PARES THINGS DOWN TO JUST WHAT WHAT IS MOST LIKELY TO GET USED
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0064974_0065048 UM
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0065188_0066103 WITH UH A AND A AND OF COURSE THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SORT OF LOSS OF FUNCTION HERE OBVIOUSLY BUT MOSTLY THAT'S RELATIVELY PERIPHERAL FUNCTIONS
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0066103_0066436 AND SO YOU GO FOR SOMETHING THAT'S FAIRLY INTUITIVE TO USE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0066436_0067215 AND UM WELL F THE FOR THE MOST PART FOR T. V. REMOTE IT'S UH THA THAT WOULD BE CHANNEL CONTROL AND VOLUME
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0067215_0067992 UM AND IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU ARE WANTING TO INCORPORATE UH CONTROL OF A D. V. D. V. D. OR UH
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0068092_0068788 V. C. R. PRESUMABLY INTO THAT THEN THERE'S A PLAY PAUSE STOP REWIND FAST FORWARD RECORD SO FORTH
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0068788_0068833 UM
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0069026_0069430 MY OWN VIEW IS THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE GOING FOR A USER FOCUSED DESIGN
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0069430_0071398 UM BUT UH THE PRO I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF THE SORT OF USER FOCUSED DESIGNS THAT ARE ABOUT IS THAT THEY SORT OF MAKE ASSUMPTIONS IN ADVANCE ABOUT WHAT UH WHAT A GIVEN USER'S GOING TO UH WANT MO WANT TO DO FROM WANT IT TO DO MOST
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0071398_0071697 SO SOMETHING THAT'S UH
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0071801_0072099 SOMETHING THAT IS MORE PROGRAMMABLE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0072099_0072958 THAT UH PERH PERHAPS HAS THE FULL RANGE OF FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE TO IT BUT YOU CAN THEN SPECIFY YOURSELF WHAT YOU'RE MOST LIKELY TO WANT
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0073062_0073652 UM SO THAT THOSE ARE THEN IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH FAIRLY MINIMAL NUMBER OF CONTROLS
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0073652_0074415 UM I LIKED EBENEZER'S IDEA OF INCLUDING A JOYSTICK IN THAT AND UH POSSIBLY A SORT OF FAIRLY MINIMAL NUMBER OF SORT OF FUNCTION BUTTONS
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0074415_0075760 AND HAVE A DISP YOU THEN HAVE SOME SORT OF BASIC DISPLAY ON IT SO THAT IF YOU'RE UM SORT OF CHA CHANGING FROM DIFFERENT MODES FOR THE DEVICE IT'LL TELL YOU JUST EXACTLY WHAT UH YOU KNOW EACH DIRECTION OF THE UH
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0076037_0076565 OF THE UM JOYSTICK'S GOING TO DO OR WHA OR WHAT EACH FUNCTION BUTTON'S GOING TO DO
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0076565_0077111 UM THIS IS ACTUALLY A AGAIN SLIGHTLY TAKING INSPIRATION OFF OF UH GAMES CONTROLLERS
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0077111_0078826 YOU KNOW THE PLAYSTATION CONTROL WHERE YOU HAVE FOUR BASIC FUNCTION BUTTONS THAT ARE JUST MARKED WITH UM DISTINCTIVE UH GEOMETRICAL SHAPES BUT THE AND THEN DEPENDENT ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH IT WHAT GAME AND SO ON UM THOSE UH THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE THEN SORT OF FURTHER SPECIFIED
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0078826_0079084 AND SO IT'S TAKING TAKING THE LEAD FROM THAT
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0079239_0079274 UM
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0079362_0079593 THAT'S IT

AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0116331_0117208 I I WAS THINKING THAT THE REMOTE THE UM SORT OF DEFAULT FUNCTIONS FOR THE JOYSTICK WOULD BE UP AND DOWN FOR UH VOLUME LEFT AND RIGHT FOR CHANNELS
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0118307_0119294 UM I THINK PROBABLY FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF HOURS OF USING IT UM BUT YOU KNOW MUSCLE MEMORY'S A WONDERFUL THING UM
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0119424_0119954 AND I THINK AND I THINK THAT SIZE OF UH DISPLAY WAS ABOUT WHAT I HAD IN MIND
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0119954_0120085 UM THOUGH
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0120196_0121467 I MEAN I W I WOULD SAY THAT UH WE COULD PROBABLY PROBABLY BE REQUIRED TO UM MO MOST OF THE MOBILE PHONE DISPLAYS YOU SEE THESE DAYS ARE COLOUR BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO STICK TO BLACK AND WHITE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0121467_0121754 SI SI SIMPLY TO KEEP M KEEP THE UNIT COST DOWN
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0121814_0122885 UM I MEAN COLOUR COULD BE A SORT OF SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT BUT UH YOU KNOW COST A BIT OF EXTRA MONEY F W W W W W ONCE EVERYONE'S GOT THE FIRST
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0122885_0123173 YOU KNOW OH COLOUR'S OUT WE'LL HAVE TO REPLACE IT WON'T WE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0123173_0123284 IT DOES NOTHING EXTRA

AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0135550_0136819 I TH THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE UH THE UH JOYSTICK IS THAT UH YOU YOU YOU THEN BASICALLY YOU CAN THEN BASICALLY PUT IT I MEAN FOR FOR T. T. FOR T. V. REMOTE ALONE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0136819_0136872 YOU COULD PUT
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0136984_0137568 UM I MEAN THERE ARE LIKE I SAY THE THE THE MAIN THINGS PEOPLE DO WITH A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL IS THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0137568_0137915 YOU CAN PACK ALL THAT ONTO WAS ONTO A SINGLE CONTROL

AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0138087_0138508 BUT UH BUT THE BUT THEN O UH OBVIOUSLY IF UH
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0138642_0139213 YOU KNOW IF YOU I IF YOU WANTED TO ACCESS FURTHER FUNCTIONS I YOU YOU THEN GET TO SORT OF MENU NAVIGATION
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0139213_0140308 I MEAN WITH THINGS LIKE CH WITH THINGS LIKE TUNING AND CHANNELS UM YOU KNOW ADJUSTING BRIGHTN UH BRIGHTNESS AND FIDDLY THINGS THAT NO ONE REALLY BOTHERS WITH
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0140308_0141014 MOST T. V. S THESE DAYS ACTUALLY HAVE MENUS ANYWAY SO THIS WOULD BE A FAIRLY RATIONAL WAY OF INTEGRA
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0141130_0141588 INTEGRATING THE UH THE REMOTE WITH THE DEVICE IT'S CONTROLLING
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0141588_0141649 UM
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0141776_0142115 CONCERN ABOUT OUR MARKET
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0142115_0142611 UM IF WE ARE I MEAN MOST OF THE UH
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0142717_0143367 OF THE REPLACEMENT REMOTE MARKET IS SORT OF REMOTE CONTROL RATIONALISATION
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0143367_0144389 UM YOU'VE GOT TWENTY DIFFERENT DEVICES IN YOUR LIVING ROOM YOU WANT ONE WO Y YOU WANT ONE THAT'LL DO THE JOB OF ALL OF THEM
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0144389_0145056 UM IF ALL YOU'RE REPLACING IS ONE OF THE YOU KNOW HOWEVER MANY REMOTES YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIVING ROOM
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0145056_0145434 UM YOU KNOW YOU STILL NEED SEPARATE REMOTES FOR EVERYTHING ELSE
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0145434_0145791 I JUST THINK THAT UH POSSIBLY MM

AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0176356_0177343 ACTUALLY I WOULD SAY MAYBE TWO TWO FUNCTION BUTTONS THE Y WE'RE NOW USING THE MENUS BUTTON AND UM AND AN OG AND AN OKAY BUTTON
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0177343_0178637 I MEAN CERTAINLY SOMETHING I'VE FOUND WITH THE JOYSTICK ON MO THE JOYSTICKS ON MOBILE PHONES IS THAT A LOT OF THE TIME TH THE DEVICE MISTAKES YOU TRYING TO MOVE IT IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER FOR PUSHING DOWN FOR OKAY
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0178689_0178797 OR VICE VERSA
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0178797_0178937 AND THAT'S REALLY IRRITATING
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0179097_0179984 THE O THE O THE OTHER DIS DESIGN CONSTRAINT I THINK WE SHOULD BEAR IN MIND IS THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW VERY MUCH USED TO USING A REMOTE CONTROL ONE HANDEDLY
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0179984_0180356 UM SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT E EVEN WITH THE JOYSTICK
AMI_ES2003b_H00_MEE011_0180356_0180888 YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CAN JUST SIT COMFORTABLY IN THE PALM OF THE HAND AND HAVE THE JOYSTICK JUST CONTROLLED BY THE THUMB

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0007059_0007862 JOYSTICK FOR USER MANIPULATION UM AND ERGONOMICS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AS WELL
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0007862_0008314 UM IT'S COME TO MY ATTENTION THE FOLLOWING
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0008314_0008788 TELETEXT HAS BECOME OUTDATED DUE TO THE POPULAT POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0008788_0009063 REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR THE T. V.
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0009063_0009132 UM
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0009283_0009704 DUE FOR UH TIME TO MARKET AND POSSIBLY ALSO COST ISSUES
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0009704_0010712 UM ALSO KEY IS THE CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD STAY RECOGNISABLE UM F UH YOUR COLOUR AND SLOGAN OF COURSE IS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THERE

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0011003_0012200 JUST TO SAY QUICKLY UH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ONLY BEING USED FOR A TELEVISION THE MACRO FACILITY MAY NOW NOT BE REQUIRED
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0012200_0012566 UM OR AT L ITS FUNCTIONALITY WOULD HAVE BEEN OF LIMITED USE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0012566_0013085 SO TO THE POINT IN MY OPINION ANYWAY THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE WORTH PURSUING
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0013085_0013512 UM IF ANYBODY DISAGREES WE CAN UH DEFINITELY SAY SO

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0102555_0103388 UM RIGHT WE CAN PROBABLY SKIP THAT FOR NOW
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0103388_0103736 SO WE'VE HAD SOME STUFF PUT FORWARD UM
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0103859_0104104 ALONG WITH THE NEW USER REQUIREMENTS
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0104541_0104895 UM WE'VE HAD A LOT OF KIND OF INPUT I'D SAY SO FAR
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0104895_0104969 UM
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0105114_0105706 I HEAR WHAT THE MARKETING EXPERT'S SAYING ABOUT UM VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROL
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0105706_0106067 HOWEVER I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF WORRIES ABOUT THAT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0106067_0107028 THE POWER REQUIRED UM AND THE ABILITY TO THE COST IT SEEMS LIKE FOR UH AN EMBEDDED SYSTEM THIS COULD CAUSE US ISSUES
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0107028_0108032 UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THAT THERE'S FAIRLY ROBUST SERVICES ON UH COMPUTERS VIA UH VIA VOICE I. B. M. DO UM DRAG AND DICTATE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0108032_0108792 BUT THESE REQUIRE A LOT OF MEMORY AND USUALLY UM STATE QUITE ADVANCED PROCESSOR REQUIREMENTS
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0108792_0110180 UM VOICE ACTIVATION COULD BE AN INTERESTING IDEA BUT I THINK THAT OUR IND INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WOULD PROBABLY UPON SOME RESEARCH SAY THAT IT'S MAYBE NOT FEASIBLE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0110180_0110455 UM THAT'S JUST MY VIEW RIGHT NOW
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0110455_0111189 HOWEVER THE IDEA OF A JOYSTICK AND THEN MAYBE AN L. C. D. WHICH HAS BEEN KIND OF PUT FORWARD SO FAR IT'S ALMOST LIKE HAVING A SMALL
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0111366_0111952 T. NOT T. V. TO SAY BUT IF YOU CAN CONTROL ALMOST ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY FROM THE DISPLAY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0111952_0112429 I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH POWER AN L. C. D. WOULD TAKE BUT IT MIGHT BE QUITE LOW
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0112891_0113838 WELL LITERALLY UM IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DISPLAY MAYBE SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN UM THOSE ON A A MOBILE PHONE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0113838_0114091 SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN READ AN AN UM FAIR AMOUNT OF INFORMATION
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0114091_0114848 TRAVERSE MAYBE QUITE A FEW MENUS IF WE MAYBE USED MOBILE PHONES AS A GOOD EXAMPLE THEY USUALLY INCORPORATE THEY HAVE THE KEYPAD
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0114848_0115346 AND THEN EVR ALL THE OTHER FUNCTIONALITY IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED INSIDE BY TRAVERSING AROUND
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0115346_0115583 THAT COULD BE ONE POSSIBILITY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0115583_0116320 UM AND THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE SAY THE COMMON BUTTONS AS YOU SAY VOLUME CONTROL CHANGING CHANNELS
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0117340_0117393 WE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0121347_0121541 I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0123027_0123346 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0123346_0123874 THAT WOULD BE MY FEELING AS WELL I THINK WE COULD POSSIBLY CREATE QUITE A USEFUL USER INTERFACE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0123874_0124169 UM NOW I MEAN I DON'T SORRY GO FOR IT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0126822_0127333 I THINK IT COULD PROBABLY BE AIMED AT MOST PEOPLE WHO'VE USED A MOBILE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0127333_0127758 AND THAT MIGHT BE JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING TRY TO TARGET MOST PEOPLE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0127758_0128201 UM IF WE ARE IF WE WERE TO FOLLOW THAT AVENUE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0128201_0128823 WE MIGHT BE S YOU KNOW UM WE'RE KIND OF ALMOST RELYING ON THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH A MOBILE PHONE I SUPPOSE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0128823_0129158 BUT THAT DOES COVER A VERY LARGE SECTION OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0129313_0130336 UM I MEAN I IMAGINE AS WELL THAT THE ACTUAL L. C. D. AND MAYBE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE JOYSTICK AS WELL WOULD BE FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0130336_0130508 WHICH MAYBE DOESN'T GET USED AS OFTEN
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0130508_0131468 MAYBE IT MAKES IT EASY FOR THEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO UM CHANGE THE CHANNELS AS IN THE FREQUENCIES AND SUCH FOR REPROGRAMMING IT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0131468_0132205 UM AND YOU CAN STILL HAVE THE MAIN BUTTONS THAT ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO TURN THE MACHINE ON AND OFF D UP AND DOWN IT DEPENDS
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0132205_0132630 I MEAN MAYBE WE HAVE THE FOL UM THE JOYSTICK AS A SEPARATE ONE FOR THE OTHER FUNCTIONS THEN
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0132630_0133313 THAT THERE'S JUST A A SMALL NUMBER OF AS YOU WERE SAYING UH BUTTONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEFINED
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0133313_0133853 SO LIKE WE GO FOR THE NICE STANDARD UM UP AND DOWN FOR AND VOLUME CONTROL
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0133853_0134274 SO THAT LITERALLY ANYBODY CAN COME ALONG PICK UP THE REMOTE AND STILL KNOW WHAT DO DO
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0134274_0135271 AND THEY CAN COMPLETELY IGNORE MOST OF THE FUNCTIONALITY WHICH WOULD BE FOR SAY THE O ACTUAL OWNER OF THE THE T. V. AND WHO WOULD NORMALLY USE THE UNIT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0135271_0135317 I DUNNO

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0145563_0146210 WELL THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE TO STICK TO I'M AFRAID THIS ISN'T ONE THAT I'VE JUST ARBITRARILY DECIDED ON
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0146210_0147011 SO UM THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE SOLID ONES THAT HAS TO BE OBEYED FOR NOW
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0147011_0147781 SO I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU BUT THIS IS OUR DESIGN SPEC FOR NOW
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0147781_0147929 'FRAID TO SAY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0147929_0147998 UM
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0148950_0149712 I WOULD SAY SO YES BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE REMOTE BOXES AND THAT IS A SEPARATE UNIT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0149712_0150295 UM I THINK THAT IT I WOULD SAY THAT THE DESIGN SPEC WE'VE BEEN WITH IS FOR THE TELEVISION ONLY FOR NOW
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0150295_0150549 AND UNTIL WE HEAR OTHERWISE WE SHOULD GO WITH JUST THAT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0150668_0150715 OKAY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0150715_0150999 MAYBE WE'LL HEAR DIFFERENTLY BUT FOR NOW

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0153200_0153395 THERE IS THAT POSSIBILITY YES
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0153395_0154000 B HOWEVER I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE'LL BE GOING WITH THAT BUT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THE AVENUE OF THE MARKETING EXPERT

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0160597_0161310 UM DIGITAL TELEPHONES UH FOR EXAMPLE ONE UNIT HAS OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT BASE UNIT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0161310_0161759 SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE'S A BUTTON BUT MAYBE IT'S A BUTTON THAT YOU ATTACH TO THE T. V.
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0161759_0162365 SOMETHING WHICH YOU WHEN YOU PRESS THAT IT WOULD BEEP TO GIVE ITS LOCATION AWAY ON THE REMOTE UNIT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0162365_0162786 AND THAT COULD BE SOMETHING COULD UM SEPARATE US A BIT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0162786_0163369 AND THAT WAY BECAUSE WE'RE ATTACHING WHAT WOULD BE A SMALL BUTTON TO THE T. V. AGAIN SAY WHAT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0163369_0164000 IT WOULD BE A SMALL TRANSMITTER UM WATCH BATTERY TYPE SCENARIO I WOULD SAY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0164000_0165276 OR SOMETHING THAT IF IT WAS PROBLEMS ENOUGH YOU COULD ACTUALLY EVEN JUST UM I DON'T POWER THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK INTO

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0173710_0174562 SO WE WELL SORRY WE COULD MAYBE EVEN GO AS FAR AS SAYING POWER BUTTON SMALL JOYSTICK L. C. D.
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0174562_0175124 AND THEN WHAT MAYBE IS IT ONE MORE BUTTON TO SAY THAT YOU'RE USING THE MENU SYSTEM
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0175124_0175492 AND WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PUSHING DOWN ON THE JOYSTICK TO SAY OKAY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0175615_0176298 SO WE'RE HAVING VERY VERY FEW BUTTONS INVOLVED BUT NAVIGATION AROUND A MENU FOR MOST THINGS
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0177347_0177391 OKAY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0178676_0178720 OKAY

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0181122_0181562 SO UM WE'RE ACTUALLY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A ROUGH IDEA
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0181562_0182143 DO WE INCORPORATE THE IDEA OF TRYING TO F LOCATE THE REMOTE CONTROL AGAIN VIA A BEEPING NOISE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0182306_0182426 DO YOU MIND LOOKING
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0183046_0183349 THE ABILITY TO LOCATE IT AGAIN
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0183349_0184090 SO THAT WOULD REQUIRE A UM TRANSMITTER MAYBE ATTACHED TO THE T. V. JUST SO THAT IT SAYS FIND ME
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0184090_0184922 AND WHAT A BASICALLY A SMALL MICROPHONE UM ON THE ACTUAL UNIT CAN MAYBE HIDE IT IN THE BASE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0184922_0184949 SORRY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0185116_0185261 SOME SPEAKER SORRY YEAH

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0186485_0187032 TH E THE TRUE FACT CONSIDERING THE COST OF AN L. E. D. WE COULD JUST INCORPORATE IT ANYWAY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0187032_0187235 THE L. E. D. S CAN BE SURPRISINGLY BRIGHT NOW
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0187381_0187467 UM
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0187635_0188038 SO BY THE SOUNDS OF IT WITH WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING SO FAR
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0188038_0188809 YOUR DESIGN UM THE USER INTERFACE IS STILL QUITE OPEN YOU COULD GO FOR QUITE AN INTERESTING DESIGN
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0188809_0189028 BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY GOING TO HAVE A VERY FEW KEY AND YOU'VE GOT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0189164_0189476 YOU KNOW A SMALL L. C. D. JOYSTICK
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0189476_0190114 E I THINK IT LEAVES YOU OPEN TO A A POTENTIAL WIDE RANGE OF SHAPES SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE IT STAND OUT SLIGHTLY
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0190114_0190827 UM IF YOU COULD LOOK INTO WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED SO FAR THE FEASIBILITY OF UM SMALL TRANSMITTER
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0190827_0191474 UM AND SUCH MAYBE IF AN L. C. D. SCREEN REQUIRES TOO MUCH POWER OR SUCH
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0191666_0192028 EBENEZER UM MARKETING EXPERT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0193129_0193747 IF YEAH IF YOU COULD MAYBE AS WELL SEE WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF THIS MINIMALIST APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0193747_0194523 WHERE OF A JOYSTICK TO CONTROL THE VERY BASIC FUNCTIONS AND THEN THE IDEA OF MANIPULATING IT LIKE YOU WOULD A MOBILE
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0194523_0194921 I DON'T KNOW HOW EASY THAT WILL BE WITHIN THE TIME FRAME BUT COULD BE SOMETHING WE COULD MAYBE LOOK INTO

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0201082_0201875 THE ELECTRONICS COULD BE S EITHER PLACED EXTERNALLY OR INTERNALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL SO THAT'S GOOD
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0201875_0202098 USES MAYBE GIVES US A NEW POTENTIAL MARKET
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0202570_0202628 'KAY

AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0207108_0207591 SO I'M NOT TOO CONCERNED A THAT WE HAVEN'T GONE INTO DEPTH ABOUT THAT
AMI_ES2003b_H01_MEE009_0207591_0207844 BUT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU COULD CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SHAPES

AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0018803_0018893 OKAY
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0018893_0019192 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT BY ME EBENEZER
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0019465_0020171 OKAY SO UM WE DID SOME RESEARCH WE ASKED ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE THEIR OPINIONS ON REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0020171_0020790 WE ASKED SOME UH OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS JUST WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0020790_0021381 GOT A LOT OF RE RESPONSES AND WE ASKED SOME VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD FEEDBACK
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0021381_0022118 PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THIS IS ONLY A HUNDRED PEOPLE SO EVEN WHEN THE GROUPS ARE DIVIDED INTO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0022118_0022739 TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE THERE'S ONLY MAYBE TEN PEOPLE FIFTEEN PEOPLE IN EACH GROUP
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0022739_0022784 OKAY
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0022908_0023441 SO WE GOT SOME THE BAD STUFF WE GOT REMOTES ARE OFTEN LOST
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0023441_0023817 I OFTEN LOSE MY REMOTE CONTROL THE BACK OF THE COUCH SOME PLACE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0023817_0024365 AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT LOST PERMANENTLY IT TAKES ME A FEW MINUTES TO FIND IT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0024365_0024823 MOST BUTTONS ARE NOT USED ANY MORE LIKE YOU SAID TELETEXT IS OUTDATED NOW
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0024823_0025208 I REMEMBER TRYING TO LOAD A D. V. D. PLAYER RECENTLY
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0025208_0025675 AND THERE WERE SO MANY BUTTONS IT TOOK ME I DON'T KNOW MAYBE TEN MINUTES TO TO GO THROUGH EACH BUTTON
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0025675_0026366 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE SHIFT BUTTON TO ACCESS THE YELLOW BUTTONS YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST A LOT OF STUFF THAT NO ONE REALLY USES
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0026366_0026511 AND IF THEY DO NOT VERY OFTEN
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0026688_0026935 TAKES TOO LONG TO MASTER THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0026935_0027320 I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE BIG THEY HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0027320_0027861 YOU HAVE TO HOLD DOWN MORE THAN ONE KEY AT ONE TIME TO DO SOMETHING THEY'RE JUST NOT GREAT TO USE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0027861_0028414 WE JUST GOT A LOT OF BAD COMPLAINTS ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0028414_0028658 SOME OF THE GOOD STUFF WE GOT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0028658_0029426 BETWEEN THE AGE OF UH FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY EXTRA FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0029426_0029770 NOW DON'T GET EXCITED YET I'VE GOT MORE TO SAY ON THAT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0029770_0030276 MOST PEOPLE'D BE WILLING TO PAY FOR THAT UM MOST PEOPLE WANT REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE PRETTY
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0030276_0030677 THEY WANT IT TO BE FANCY TH THEY THEY WANT IT TO BE DIFFERENT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0030677_0031502 EVERYBODY HAS A WHITE REMOTE CONTROL WITH BLACK BUTTONS AND A RED BUTTON AND A GREEN BUTTON NOT EVERYBODY WANTS THAT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0031502_0031630 FINALLY MY OPINION
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0031831_0032089 THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING IS COOL
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0032089_0032548 AND UH VOICE RECOGNITION THE SOFTWARE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE EXIST ALREADY
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0032548_0033060 IT'S A BIT SKETCHY AT SOME TIMES UH YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET GOOD ALWAYS ACCURATE RESULTS
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0033060_0033397 BUT FOR A VERY FIXED NUMBER OF WORDS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0033397_0033820 HOW MANY DIFFERENT WORDS CAN YOU HAVE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0033820_0034230 CHANNEL FIVE CHANNEL SEVEN YOU KNOW HOW MANY YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT MANY WORDS
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0034230_0034555 FOR A FIXED VOCABULARY IT WORKS QUITE WELL
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0034555_0034746 I'M PRETTY SURE PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0034746_0035003 BUT AFTER A WHILE PEOPLE MAY WANNA RETURN IT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0035003_0035717 BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO TO SAY SOM I MEAN MOST PEOPLE USE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR SWITCHING TO CHANNELS
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0035717_0035953 AND THEY SAY THEY DO THAT ABOUT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE TIME
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0035953_0036447 USING THE REMOTE CONTROL NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE TIME FOR CHANGING CHANNELS AND THAT'S FOR FLICKERING THROUGH CHANNELS
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0036447_0036935 SO IF YOU HAVE TO SAY UP UP UP UP
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0036935_0037354 IF YOU HAVE TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME THEN PEOPLE MIGHT GET A BIT FED UP WITH THAT AND THEY MAY RETURN IT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0037438_0038023 HOWEVER OH BECAUSE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE EXISTS ALREADY
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0038023_0038651 THERE'S NO NEED TO SPEND MONEY ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUT THIS DOES MEAN THE NEED FOR MICROPHONES IN THE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0038764_0039117 IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS AN UNUSUAL FEATURE IN MY OPINION
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0039117_0039764 BUT IF WE DO HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT YOU CAN UH GET RID OF
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0039764_0039900 SEE YOU COULD THERE'RE TWO OPTIONS
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0039900_0040689 EITHER YOU HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION BY ITSELF WHICH I THINK IS A BIT IMPRACTICAL FOR LIKE NIGHT TIME IF YOU WANNA BE WATCHING TELEVISION AND YOU WANNA BE QUIET
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0040689_0041418 OR I DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE A VISITOR COMING ROUND AND THE REMOTE'S ONLY TRAINED FOR YOU IT'S A BIT IMPRACTICAL TO HAVE JUST VOICE RECOGNITION BY ITSELF
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0041418_0041802 SO YOU CAN HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION AND A REGULAR REMOTE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0041802_0042461 BUT IMAGINE YOU GOT RID OF THE REGULAR REMOTE PART THEN YOU CAN DESIGN THE REMOTE TO LOOK ANY WAY YOU WANT IT TO LOOK
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0042461_0042785 BECAUSE THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON PHYSICAL SIZE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0042785_0043157 OR SHAPE IT IT COULD BE AS FANCY AS YOU WANT IT TO BE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0043157_0043533 YOU KNOW IT COULD BE LIKE A LOLLIPOP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETHING WEIRD LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0043533_0043842 AS LONG AS THE VOICE RECOGNITION STUFF WORKS THAT'S THAT'S FINE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0043983_0044543 SO WE HAVE THE THREE BIRDS WE HAVE THE DESIGN THAT WE HAVE THE THE FANCY BIT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0044543_0045060 RIGHT THE VOICE RECOGNITION'S FANCY IT'S COOL IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S RADICAL SO
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0045060_0045702 AND THEN WE HAVE AN EXTRA BIT I DON'T REMEMBER SO I'M PRETTY SURE PEOPLE WILL BUY THE REMOTE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0045702_0046281 BUT IS IT PRACTICAL TO HAVE A VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IN A REMOTE CONTROL I THINK IS A BIG QUESTION
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0046281_0046409 UM WILL PEOPLE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0046548_0047003 WILL PEOPLE BE WILLING TO WAIT FOR THE THE PERIOD THAT IT'LL TAKE TO TRAIN THE REMOTE
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0047003_0047588 'CAUSE I THINK IT WILL THE REMOTE WILL UH GET BETTER OVER TIME WITH THE SAME USER USER
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0047588_0048262 BUT FOR THE FIRST WEEK OR FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS ARE YOU WILLING TO WAIT ARE YOU WILLING TO HAVE A BAD REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0048262_0048724 AND UH WHAT IF YOU HAVE VISITORS COME ROUND THEY STAY THE NIGHT THEY WANNA USE THE T. V.
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0048724_0049092 THEY CAN'T USE THE REMOTE BECAUSE THEY SPEAK DIFFERENTLY TO YOU
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0049092_0049454 UM HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR REGIONAL ACCENTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0049454_0049757 UH WILL PEOPLE RETURN THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0049757_0050187 I THINK A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL IF THEY HAVE THE MONEY YOU KNOW SO
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0050187_0050919 DO OUR AUDIENCE HAVE THE MONEY BUT WOULD THEY RETURN IT AFTER A WHILE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS FAST AS PRESSING A BUTTON IT'S NOT A PRACTICAL
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0050919_0051047 SO
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0051047_0051253 THESE ARE THINGS I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0051253_0051342 I THINK IT'S COOL
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0051523_0051555 I'M SORRY

AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0052064_0052325 BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME CONSIDERATIONS
AMI_ES2003b_H02_MEE012_0052408_0052487 SO YEAH

AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0090674_0091034 I CAN ADD PRETTY PICTURES TO THIS
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0091034_0091160 THE UM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0091398_0092266 ASSUMING THE HAND THE HAND TO BE IN ABOUT SORT OF THIS POSITION UM HOL UH HOLDING THE REMOTE
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0092266_0093344 THE UM THE JOYSTICK UNIT SHOULD REST OVER THE UH THE JOINT OF THE F OF THE UH FOUR FINGER SO THAT IT'S DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE FOR THE THUMB
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0093344_0094292 UM AND IT WOULD NEED T THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A IT WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED JUST BELOW THAT SO THAT IT COULD BE SWITCHED AROUND FOR UH LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USERS
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0094292_0094385 SO
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0095071_0095904 YOU THEN HAVE A GRIP SECTION THAT CAN BE MORE OR LESS THE SAME IRRESPECTIVE OF HANDEDNESS
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0095904_0096517 YOU JUST HAVE BIG TWO BIG BUTTONS THAT COVER MOST OF THE AREA SO IT CAN IN THE UPPER PART
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0096517_0096778 ONE FOR THE FOUR FINGER ONE FOR THE MIDDLE FINGER
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0096778_0096874 UM AND THAT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0096980_0097341 TH THIS PART HERE IS THE JOYSTICK
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0097341_0097584 THIS WOULD BE THE ACTUAL GRIP
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0097584_0097959 PROBABLY WHERE YOU'D WANT TO HAVE THE BATTERY AS WELL
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0097959_0098231 THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY THE BULKIEST PART
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0098231_0098970 AND YOU THEN HAVE AT THE UH AT THE BOTTOM THE L. C. D. AND THIS WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED AS WELL
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0098970_0099408 AND BASICALLY I'D WANT THIS TO REST HERE RIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE WRIST
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0099408_0099591 SO IT WOULD FIT JUST NICELY IN THE HAND
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0099591_0099839 AND AGAIN THIS PART COULD BE
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0100009_0100187 ROTATED SO IT CAN
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0100735_0101314 SO SO SO THAT IT CAN BE ADJUSTED TO EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USER
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0101314_0101371 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0101707_0102481 SO THE T UH THE TOP FUNCTION BUTTON IN BASIC MODE WOULD BE THE ON OFF SWITCH AND MENU MODE WOULD BE THE ENTER BUTTON
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0102481_0102852 AND THEN THE BOTTOM FUNCTION BUTTONS SWITCHES BETWEEN BETWEEN MODES
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0102852_0103566 UM NOW PROGRAMMING IT ACTUALLY THI THIS IS ONE THING I'VE FOUND WITH UM THE REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0103566_0103833 PROGRAMMING THEM CAN BE A RIGHT PAIN
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0103833_0104211 SO I THOUGHT TH THE SIMPLEST WAY AROUND THAT WOULD BE TO HAVE UM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0104235_0105741 A CABLE TO CONNECT IT TO THE COMPUTER SOME SOME FAIR IV FAIRLY FAIRLY SIMPLE SOFTWARE ON THE COMPUTER JUST SO THAT YOU ON YOUR COMPUTER JUST SO THAT YOU COULD UM PR PROGRAM IT AT A RATHER IN A RATHER MORE COMFORTABLE INTERFACE
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0105741_0106552 AND YOU COULD DOWNLOAD PROGRAMS FOR IT FROM UH FOR UH T. V. S FROM ALL SORT OF MAIN MANUFACTURERS
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0106552_0107822 UM THOUGH YOU I IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO HAVE UH HAVE A M UH HAVE A HA HAVE A MODE FOR PROGRAMMING IT WITHOUT THE COMPUTER
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0107822_0108259 UH JUST IN CASE THERE ARE THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE LEFT OUT THERE WHO DON'T HAVE THEM YET
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0108259_0108450 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0108450_0108546 BUT UH
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0108546_0108583 YEAH
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0108933_0109186 THAT'S THAT'S MY IDEA
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0140040_0140074 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0142441_0142475 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0144049_0144607 YEAH ACTUALLY IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CHANNELS THE NUMBER KEYPAD CAN BE QUITE ANNOYING AS WELL
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0144607_0145298 BECAU IT'S YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT UH YOU KNOW WHAT NUMBER'S THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL OR WHATEVER
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0145298_0145431 IT'S JUST IRRITATING
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0145431_0145856 BUT IF YOU H BUT BUT BUT IF YOU HAVE A ME BUT IF YOU HAVE A MENU STRUCTURE THEN YOU CAN SUB GROUP THEM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0145957_0146162 SO YOU
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0146383_0146414 YEAH
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0150091_0150289 YEAH I I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0150289_0151307 I MEAN I MEAN I MEAN THE THE IDEA OF HAVING IT SORT OF ARTICULATED I TH THERE WOULD BE BASICALLY TWO POINTS OF ARTICULATION
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0151307_0151849 W UM ONE BELOW AND ONE ABOVE THE M THE UH THE MAIN SORT OF GRIP
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0151975_0152038 SO
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0152982_0153206 MM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0153480_0154115 I D I DON'T THI I DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A A STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0154115_0154677 I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A FIRM S SUB STRUCTURE YOU CAN THEN INCORPORATE ARTICULATION INTO THAT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0154677_0155617 IF YOU THEN HAVE A SORT OF OUTER SKIN OF MM FLEXIBLE SPONGY RUBBER THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW VERY MUCH YOU KNOW
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0155703_0156159 ORGANIC AND I THINK WOULD LOOK RATHER CO I MEAN MI RATHER COOL
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0156159_0156372 I MEAN MY DRAWING THERE DOESN'T DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0156372_0157069 IT MAKES IT MAKES IT LOOK MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A VIBRATOR THAN A THAN A UH THAN A REMOTE CONTROL BUT UH
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0158945_0159001 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0159352_0159514 MAKE IT HARDER TO LOSE AS WELL
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0162272_0162935 I TH UH I MEAN IF IT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD PERHAPS BE PROGRAMMABLE THOUGH MAYBE HAVE MONKEY AS DEFAULT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0162935_0162977 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0164305_0164338 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0164780_0165991 WELL BASI BASICALLY THE UM FOR F FOR UH I MEAN E EACH MANUFACTURER WILL HAVE A PARTIC WILL HAVE A PARTICULAR COMMAND SET THAT UH THE T. V. RESPONDS TO
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0165991_0166196 IT'S NOT SIMPLY A MATTER OF FREQUENCY
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0166196_0166382 SO UM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0166501_0167489 USUALLY WHAT'S DONE IS YOU HAVE THIS BIG BOOKLET FULL OF DIFFERENT POSSI YOU'LL HAVE ALL OF THEM SORT OF PROGRAMMED IN TO THE UH REMOTE
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0167489_0168453 AND YOU'LL HAVE THIS LITTLE BOOKLET OF CODES YOU THEN FIND YOUR UM MA UH FIND YOUR MANUFACTURER AND TRY THE DIFFERENT CODES THAT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0168562_0168876 COME UNDER THAT MANUFACTURER'S NAME 'TIL YOU FIND THE RIGHT ONE
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0168876_0168921 IT'S
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0169298_0169431 YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0169431_0170051 SO THAT'S THAT'S QUITE ANNOYING AND WE PROBABLY WOULD STILL HAVE TO DO THAT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0170051_0170787 BUT IF WE HAD UM SOME SORT OF HOOK UP TO YOUR COMPUTER AS AN OPTION THEN IF YOU'VE GOT A COMPUTER YOU CAN AVOID THAT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0170894_0171159 RATHER IRRITATING THING
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0172619_0172650 YEAH
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0172843_0172917 YEAH
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0174387_0174579 UM BOOKLET
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0174579_0174694 SOME PAGES
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0175926_0175966 YEAH

AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0176239_0176420 BUT IT'S A BUT IT'S A NUISANCE
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0176420_0177219 AND IT'S A NUISANCE VERY CLOSE TO THE TO UM TO ACTUALLY PURCHASING IT SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE THINKING ABOUT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0177219_0178272 IF YOU IF THERE'S W I IF THERE'S ONE IN THE SHOP THAT'S THAT SAYS IT CAN AVOID MUCH OF THAT NUISANCE YOU MIGHT BE FAVOURABLY INCLINED TOWARDS IT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0178272_0178603 UM MM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0186305_0186366 MM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0186968_0187949 UM WELL I I THINK OTHER THAN GE GETTING A SORT OF MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING FORM FOR IT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0187949_0188760 UM MO MOST OF THE SORT OF LAYOUT DESIGN DECISIONS ARE ARE MADE I WOULD SAY
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0188760_0189889 UM BUT THEN AGAIN THE UM THE MENU STRUCTURE TO TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT THAT'S GONNA VARY ACCORDING TO THE MODEL OF TELEVISION
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0189889_0190317 AND ALSO ANY CUSTOMISATIONS THAT THE USER MIGHT WISH TO INCORPORATE
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0190317_0191167 SO UM AND ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT HAVING AN L. C. D. AND A MENU STRUCTURE IS THAT THERE IS THAT FLEXIBILITY TO IT
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0201568_0201598 YEAH
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0207431_0207469 MM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0207691_0207829 YEAH I MEAN IT'S

AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0208623_0209458 THE OTHER THING I MEAN IT I MEAN IT WOULD NEED TO HA IT WOULD NEED TO HAVE UM SOME SORT OF ON BOARD MEMORY ANYWAY
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0209458_0210342 UM F FOR ONE FOR ONE THING BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THE MENU SYSTEM SHOULD BE UM UH I MEAN ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0210342_0210932 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TERRIBLY COMPLICATED IF IT'S JUST CONTROLLING ONE DEVICE THE MENU SYSTEM OUGHT TO BE UM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0211112_0211363 O OUGHT TO BE CUSTOMISABLE AND UH
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0211671_0211753 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0211753_0212617 HOW UH HOW UH HOW YOU WANT SAY THE UM THE THE MENU STRUCTURE FOR FLICKING THROUGH CHANNELS IF YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF CHANNELS
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0212617_0212719 THAT SORT OF THING
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0215802_0215852 YEAH
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0216456_0216786 ARE WE GOING TO BE SUPPLIED WITH THE CLAY IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0216786_0216880 WHERE IS THE CLAY
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0217596_0217639 MM-HMM

AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0220398_0221312 I HAVING IT I HAVING IT SORT OF BR BRIGHT YELLOW I THINK THAT'S QUITE A GOOD IDEA THOUGH MAYBE WE COULD HAVE OPTIONS FOR COLOURS AS WELL
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0221567_0221930 AND AGAIN THIS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING HARDER TO LOSE
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0222456_0222489 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003c_H00_MEE011_0223523_0223565 MM

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0001327_0001450 CRACK ON
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0001450_0001996 OKAY SO WE'LL START OFF WITH A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE MINUTES
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0001996_0002718 I THINK TO SUM UP THE LAST MEETING WOULD BE TO SAY UM THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'VE UM SET OUT
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0002718_0003518 THOSE ARE WE WERE GOING TO GO FOR WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FAIRLY MINIMAL DESIGN BASED ON UH A SMALL JOYSTICK
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0003634_0004801 L. C. D. AND A COUPLE OF OTHER BUTTONS FOR NAVIGATION UM WITH POWER BEING I SUPPOSE ONE OF THE MAIN SINGLE PURPOSE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0004801_0005575 UM WE WERE ALSO GOING TO USE NOVELTY OF BEING ABLE TO LOCATE THE REMOTE CONTROL AGAIN VIA A SMALL TRANSMITTER WITH ANY LUCK
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0005575_0005961 THE IDEA TO TRY AND SEPARATE US AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE MINIMAL DESIGN
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0006028_0006833 UM LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE FAIRLY ADVENTUROUS IN THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL SHAPE OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH ANY LUCK
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0006833_0007206 UM THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP THE LAST ONE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0007206_0007976 SO WE'LL JUST CRACK ON UM LIKE TO MAYBE START WITH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER IF IT'S POSSIBLE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0007976_0008420 UM UH THE CON TODAY IS THE CONCEP TODAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0008420_0008958 THIS UH MEETING IS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE AND IS UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0009093_0009587 SORRY ABOUT THIS
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0009587_0010202 AND IS TO COVER THINGS LIKE UM WHAT THE PARTS MIGHT BE MADE OF UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0010202_0010784 CAN WE UH OUTSOURCE THESE FROM ELSEWHERE UM WILL WE HAVE TO CONSTRUCT ANY ITEMS OURSELVES
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0011135_0011534 YEAH OKAY WELL I'LL JUST UH I'LL LOAD IT UP THEN
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0011534_0011740 UM

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0021948_0022736 UM THE BAT UH THE BATTERY FOR A A WATCH WOULDN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF POWER WOULD BE MY ONE QUERY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0022736_0023153 IS A KINETIC ONE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPLY ENOUGH POWER
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0023272_0023318 DO YOU THINK
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0023560_0023581 W
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0025616_0025954 WHICH I SUPPOSE AS WELL WOULD ALLOW US TO GO OFF THE SHELF AGAIN YOU'D SAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0029098_0029272 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0029272_0029302 UM

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0029522_0030002 UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D BE ABLE TO OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD OR NOT THE SINGLE CURVED AND DOUBLE CURVED
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0030002_0030295 WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0030295_0030545 UM COULD YOU MAYBE DRAW SOMETHING
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0030545_0031097 I YOU DON'T DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT IT'S JUST 'CAUSE I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0035623_0036068 SO IT MIGHT LITERALLY JUST BE OKAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0036737_0036792 ALRIGHT

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0044120_0044745 OKAY THAT WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE CAN TALK ABOUT
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0044745_0045298 UM SO YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THE CHIP THAT WE MIGHT REQUIRE AS WELL
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0046842_0047165 UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA SO FAR
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0047165_0047846 LIKE WHEN WE'RE SAYING THAT WE'D NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR AN L. C. D. DOES THAT IN SHOOT THE COST UP BY A DRASTIC AMOUNT
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0047846_0047902 OR
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0048235_0048543 WELL I THINK COMPARED TO SAY JUST PRESSING BUTTONS
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0048710_0049765 IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON THAT SENDS A CERTAIN TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE INFRA RED WHEREAS I THINK IF WE'RE CONTROLLING THE L. C. D. WE DEFINITELY REQUIRE A MUCH MORE POWERFUL CHIP
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0049765_0050283 JUST COMPARED TO THE CHIP YOU WOULD USE FOR PUSHING BUTTONS I THINK IS THE THE POINT BEING MADE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0050283_0050452 IF I'VE NOT OVER STEPPED

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0052834_0052927 I ASSUME
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0052927_0053148 WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE COSTS OF THOSE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0053148_0053279 SO SORRY

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0059516_0060459 SO IN THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN SUPPLIED HOW FEASIBLE WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE IDEA OF USING AN L. C. D. LOOKS
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0063857_0064147 UM I MEAN THAT SOUNDS LIKE QUITE A GOOD REQUIREMENT TO ME
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0064147_0064445 UM CONVENTIONAL BATTERY WOULD SEEM TO MAKE SENSE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0064445_0065129 UM I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANY COST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SINGLE AND DOUBLE CURVED AND I'M I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0065129_0065839 BUT PLASTIC OR RUBBER AS A TRADITIONAL FORM OF CASING WOULD SEEM TO BE A GOOD WAY FORWARD
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0066599_0066639 OKAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0066934_0067089 OKAY WELL UM

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0083667_0083875 CAN I JUST JUMP IN SLIGHTLY THERE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0083875_0084245 THAT WOULD SUGGEST THE DOUBLE CURVED DESIGN'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE MOST APPROPRIATE THEN
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0084355_0084466 OKAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0087241_0087299 MM

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0138230_0138274 OKAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0138756_0139336 WELL UM I WOULD SAY THAT THE MOST YOU COULD PROBABLY HOPE FOR IS GAINING A YEAR'S LEAD ON MOST PEOPLE ANYWAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0139336_0140077 YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BRING OUT NEW DESIGNS SO IF WE CAN GET NEXT YEAR THEN THAT'S POSSIBLY A GOOD PLACE TO START ANYWAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0140077_0140153 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0140839_0141490 SEEMS LIKE A A LOT OF THE COMPONENTS COULD BE OFF THE SHELF SO I DON'T EXACTLY WHAT COST WOULD BE INCURRED
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0141490_0141842 UM I CAN SEE YOUR POINT ABOUT THE NUMBER KEYPAD
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0141842_0142797 BUT I'VE I WOULD SAY THAT WE CAN PROBABLY INCORPORATE IT INTO THE MENU SYSTEM IF YOU NEED TO DO TRAVERSAL OF A LARGE NUMBER OF CHANNELS
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0142797_0144027 MY FEELING WOULD BE THAT EVEN IF AT A LATER DATE THIS WAS TO BE TAKING CONTROL OF UM BOXES AS WELL UM HAVING THE USE OF THE L. C. D. AND THE JOYSTICK WOULD PROBABLY ALLOW YOU TO MANIPULATE ENOUGH CHANNEL NUMBERS FOR YOU TO BE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0145416_0145455 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0145974_0146014 OKAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0146556_0147112 SO WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME IS WE'LL USE A LARGE NUMBER OF STANDARD COMPONENTS UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0147246_0148078 SAY SOMETHING LIKE UM LITHIUM ION BATTERY THE KIND THAT YOU FIND IN MOST UM SMALL HAND HELD DEVICES NOW
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0148078_0148161 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0148278_0148553 LOOKS LIKE WE GOING FOR A DOUBLE CURVED DESIGN
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0148553_0148884 UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT COST IMPLICATIONS THERE ARE IN THAT
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0148884_0149443 UM LOOKS LIKE WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DECIDED ON SOME KIND OF FLEXIBLE RUBBER
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0149443_0150036 THOUGH I'D HAVE TO SAY DEPENDING ON HOW FLEXIBLE IT IS WE MIGHT NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF INNER FRAME
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0151928_0152302 DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY WAY WE COULD MAYBE REMOVE THE ARTICULATION
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0152302_0152966 I CAN SEE WHY IT LOOKS APPEALING BUT IT COULD BE A WEAK POINT IN UM THE STRUCTURE DO YOU THINK
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0152966_0153112 THAT WOULD BE A WORRY OF MINE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0157071_0157234 YEAH WE WON'T ADD THAT FUNCTIONALITY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0157349_0157804 HOWEVER ONE INTERESTING POINT IS I DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS YOU WERE THERE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0157804_0158682 BUT WE IF WE TAKE SOME OF THE IDEAS WHY DON'T WE MAKE THE DAMN THING YELLOW TO INCORPORATE THE DES THE COLOUR OF THE LOGO
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0158851_0158904 I DUNNO
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0158904_0159201 IT'S AN CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT COLOUR FROM YOUR AVERAGE UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0159631_0159789 THAT'S TRUE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0159789_0159941 WAS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR RESEARCH
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0165864_0165918 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0171157_0172078 AN INTERESTING POINT IS THAT IF THE PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THE COMPUTER WE CAN STILL MAKE THE PROCESS EASIER BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO LOOK UP CODES
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0172078_0173349 MAYBE WE CAN HAVE IT THAT ONE OF THE OPTIONS THEY HAVE IS THAT THEY LOOK UP THE NAME OF THE COMPANY ON THE L. C. D. AND THEN THEY MAYBE LOOK UP DIFFERENT NAMES OF UM DIFFERENT ACTUAL UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0173349_0173873 OR WE HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL JUST GO THROUGH THEM UNTIL IT'S LIKE DOES THIS DO THE CORRECT FUNCTION AND SUCH
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0175944_0176182 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE USED VERY OFTEN THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0178741_0179285 OKAY THIS JUST TO GIVE US A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE MEANT TO BE DOING FOR THE NEXT STAGE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0179285_0179556 I'M PRETTY SURE THAT YOU GOT THAT ANYWAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0179556_0179748 THIS IS THE CONCEPTUAL ONE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0179748_0179819 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0179958_0180372 I THINK WE'VE COME UP I THINK WE'VE COVERED EVERYTHING WE NEED TO HERE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0180372_0180978 UM I THINK WE'VE DECIDED ON WHAT YOU KNOW DECIDED ON STANDARD ITEMS FOR MOST OF UM RUBBER AND SUCH
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0180978_0181464 SO WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT THE DETAILED DESIGN AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING FOR THE NEXT MEETING
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0181464_0181537 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0181848_0182111 SO FOR EXAMPLE UM I'LL JUST START AT THE TOP
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0182111_0182887 YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF AND THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER GONNA BE WORKING QUITE CLOSELY AT THIS STAGE 'CAUSE IT'LL BE HARD NOT TO OBVIOUSLY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0182887_0182949 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0183312_0183857 LOOKING FROM PROTOTYPING OF SOME DES DESCRIPTION USING CLAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0183857_0184312 UM I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE TOLD A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT AS UH PROGRESS
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0184312_0184393 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0184598_0184739 THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0184968_0185672 THEY'RE KIND OF IT LOOKS THEY'RE THE IDEA I'VE PUSHED FORWARD SO FAR IS MAYBE MORE OF A PHYSICAL ONE THERE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0185672_0186299 WHEREAS POSSIBLY BE MORE INTERESTED IN MAYBE HOW THE L. C. D. 'S GOING TO INCORPORATE DO YOU THINK
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0186299_0186880 OR DO YOU S PERCEIVE THAT MOST THE DESIGN DESIGN DECISIONS STILL NEED TO BE BASED ON THE PHYSICAL LAYOUT
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0191206_0191374 MM-HMM THAT'S VERY TRUE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0191505_0191624 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0191803_0191960 OKAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0191960_0192223 UM GOT PRODUCT EVALUATION AS WELL
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0192223_0192302 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0193315_0193609 I I THINK WE'D BE YEAH NO
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0193609_0194397 IT'D BE MORE A CASE OF HOW DO WE ENVISAGE US PERFORMING THE PRODUCT EVALUATION ONCE WE HAVE A MODEL TO TEST WITH
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0194576_0195162 UM SO IT'D BE A CASE OF DO YOU THINK THAT JUST BRINGING USERS IN TO HAVE THEM TEST IT OUT
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0195162_0195758 UH MAYBE PUTTING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PRODUCTS INTO THE FIELD IN CERTAIN PLACES WHICH I SUPPOSE IS QUITE SIMILAR
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0195758_0196544 OR JUST KIND OF HITTING THE STREETS AND YOU KNOW SAYING THIS IS A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LOOK OF IT
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0196544_0196630 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0197236_0198173 I THINK THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY UNDER THE AGE OF SAY MAYBE SIXTY OR SOMETHING LUDICROUS
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0198173_0198717 UM THE REASON I'M SAYING THAT IS WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT A A REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0198717_0199278 SOMETHING THAT'S STYLISH SO MAYBE YOU'RE EVEN JUST MAYBE YOU'RE NARROWING DOWN YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE SIMPLY BY SAYING
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0199405_0199878 IF THEY'RE BUYING IT THAT OFTEN OR THEY'RE MAYBE LOOKING TO REPLACE SOMETHING THEN
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0199878_0200343 THEY'VE GOT A BIT OF FREE CASH SO THAT PUTS THEM POTENTIALLY IN THE YOUNGER AGE BRACKET
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0200343_0200898 MAYBE EVEN SINGLE JUST FOR THE REASONS OF UM UH EXCESS CASH FLOW
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0201086_0201616 ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I MEAN AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS I DON'T THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT CHARGING THE EARTH FOR THE UH DEVICE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0201616_0201800 THINK THAT'S WELL WITHIN THE NORMAL BRACKET
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0201800_0202342 UM YOUR IDEA OF THE U. S. B. WOULD I THINK WOULD LARGELY DEPEND ON THE COST
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0202342_0202653 U. S. B. 'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THE CHEAPEST INTERFACES OUT THERE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0202653_0203711 BUT IT MIGHT PUSH THE COST OF THE OVERALL UNIT UP 'CAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE NOT JUST THE CONNECTION BUT THE CHIP FOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE REST OF THE SYSTEM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0203711_0203891 THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE TO BE BASED ON
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0204183_0205188 THE THE IDEA WAS THAT MAYBE IT COULD CONNECT UP FOR UM ALLOWING A SOFTWARE INTERFACE ON THE P. C. FOR A LARGER PROGRAMMING DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE'VE GONE FOR SUCH A NICE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0205188_0205356 EASY MINIMAL DESIGN NORMALLY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0205500_0205559 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0206073_0206275 IT'S JUST FOR T. V. BUT FOR
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0206394_0206826 PROGRAMMING IT TO USE YOUR T. V. YOU MIGHT HOOK IT UP TO THE P. C.
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0206826_0207434 I I'M NOT SURE BUT I'M THINKING MAYBE THAT THE ADDITIONAL COST OF THE U. S. B. MIGHT BE PROHIBITIVE
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0207434_0207640 WE DON'T KNOW UNLESS IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0215321_0215775 UM YOU'RE GONNA LOOK A BIT MORE AT THE KIND OF THE PHYSICAL MAKE UP YOU SAY
AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0215775_0216314 UM LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA NEED A MAYBE A KIND OF PROTOTYPE IN CLAY

AMI_ES2003c_H01_MEE009_0216457_0216528 UM

AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0110489_0110601 OKAY
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0110935_0111388 SO UH TO GATHER MY RESEARCH TWO BASIC METHODS
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0111388_0112055 WE COMPARED UH WHETHER PEOPLE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO DO A LOT OF STUFF OR THEY WANT IT TO LOOK COOL
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0112055_0112795 AND THEN WE WE RESEARCH UH FASHION TRENDS IN EUROPE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE NEW BLACK YOU KNOW AS IT GOES
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0112795_0112855 NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0113002_0113752 UH WE FOUND IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE PEOPLE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO LOOK COOL MORE THAN THEY WANT IT TO TO BE COOL
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0113752_0114166 AS IN THEY WANT IT TO DO A LOT OF GOOD S THEY WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE IT DOES A LOT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0114166_0114621 AND IF IT DOES DO A LOT THAT'S A BONUS BUT THEY DON'T CARE SO MUCH YOU KNOW
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0114621_0114934 THEY WANT IT TO BE THAT'S SOUNDS A BIT LIKE A CONTRADICTION
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0115009_0115511 TECHNOLOGY TECHNICAL TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0115511_0116043 PEOPLE WANT IT TO BE THAT BUT S STILL THEY CARE MORE ABOUT THE WAY IT LOOKS THAN WHAT IT DOES
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0116043_0116372 SO LIKE THE INTERFACE IS REALLY IMPORTANT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0116372_0116496 AND EASY TO USE
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0116496_0117469 IT IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT UH FROM THE SECOND POINT TO THE THIRD POINT IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT I MEAN THE SECOND POINT IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE THIRD POINT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0117469_0117562 PEOPLE WANT IT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0117822_0118210 I IS IT HAS TO BE COOLER THAN EASY TO USE YOU KNOW IF IT HAS THE NEWEST FEATURES
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0118210_0118678 EVEN IF IT'S DIFFICULT TO USE PREFER IT TO HAVE THE NEWEST FEATURES
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0118678_0118942 AND IF IT'S EASY TO USE THAT'S A BONUS
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0118942_0119220 THE FASHION NOW THIS IS SEEMS A BIT ODD TO ME
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0119220_0119769 BUT FRUIT AND VEG IS THE NEW IS THE NEW BLACK FOR FURNITURE FOR CLOTHES FOR SHOES
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0119843_0120102 HOW THAT RELATES TO A REMOTE CONTROL I DON'T KNOW
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0120102_0120509 BUT I I SEE I COME ON TO THAT IN THE NEXT IN THE NEXT SLIDE
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0120509_0120597 SPONGY
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0120597_0120779 I'VE ALS I'VE BEEN SAYING EVERYTHING'S THE NEW BLACK
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0120779_0120956 WELL SPONGY'S THE NEW BLACK AS WELL
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0120956_0121232 SO WE HAVE THE CHOICE BETWEEN RUBBER AND PLASTIC
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0121232_0121810 IF IT'S THE TYPE OF RUBBER THAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE YOU KNOW IT'S SPONGY THEN CAN I SKIP THE REST
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0122332_0122368 OKAY
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0122525_0122902 OKAY SO KINDA SPONGY MATERIAL
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0122902_0123351 SO UM SO MY PERSONAL OPINION
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0123468_0124092 UM WE WANT SOMETHING FANCY AND TECHNI TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE OBVIOUSLY
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0124092_0124667 BUT WHAT WE WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THE FUTURE THAT LOOKS COOL THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0124667_0125182 YOU KNOW THAT'S EVERYONE HAS A WHITE REMOTE CONTROL BLACK REMOTE CONTROL YOU NEED SOMETHING COOL
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0125182_0125457 LIKE TITANIUM IS COOL BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0125457_0125802 AND MAYBE IT'S A BIT OF OVERKILL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0125858_0126516 UM NOW THE FRUIT AND VEG OPTIONS EITHER WE WE GO IN THAT DIRECTION OR WE STAY TOTALLY AWAY FROM IT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0126516_0127193 UM I MEAN THE RESEARCH DID COME UP WITH FRUIT AND VEG SO MAYBE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR IT'S THE UP TO THE INTERFACE GUY
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0127193_0127496 SO IF WE STAY AWAY FROM IT S YOU KNOW STAY AWAY FROM IT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0127496_0128283 BUT IF WE'RE GONNA GO ALONG WITH IT THEN IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE LIKE AN APPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR A KIWI FRUIT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0128283_0128395 IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0128454_0129006 I SAY POTATO PEELER BUT I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE A HAVE A MUCH COOLER IDEA THAN I DO
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0129006_0129277 SO I THINK COOL IS THE KEY
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0129277_0129617 FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT A SPONGY REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0129617_0129720 I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0129720_0129934 I'VE SEEN PLASTIC REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0129934_0130041 I THINK MAYBE THEY WERE
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0130247_0130692 I DON'T KNOW BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THEY FIRST CAME UP WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THEY HAD A REASON FOR IT BEING
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0130874_0131034 STURDY YOU KNOW
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0131034_0131198 FOR BEING STRONG AND STURDY
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0131198_0131961 SO UM IF WE WANT SOMETHING STRONG AND STURDY I SAY STAY WITH PLASTIC OR TITANIUM BUT IF WE GO WITH SPONGY
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0131961_0132548 WE CAN STRESS THAT YOU CAN DROP THIS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S SPONGY MATERIAL IT'S NOT GONNA BREAK YOU KNOW
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0132548_0133400 I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THE L. E. D. AND THE LIGHTS ARE GONNA FIT INTO A SPONGY MATERIAL BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE COMPLETELY SQUEEZABLE
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0133400_0133539 SO HOW DO THINGS FIT IT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0133568_0134435 AND IF WE ARE GONNA USE SPONGY WE CAN SAY IT'S LONG LASTING YOU KNOW IT'S DAMAGE RESISTANT AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0134435_0135029 SO JUST TO SUMMARISE PEOPLE WANT STUFF THAT'S COOL THAT'S THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COOL
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0135029_0135616 AND IF IT IS COOL THEN THAT'S A BONUS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE UM PEOPLE LIKE FRUIT AND VEG
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0135616_0136004 WE CAN EITHER GO DOWN THAT ALLEY OR STAY TOTALLY AWAY FROM IT
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0136004_0136115 PEOPLE LIKE SPONGY MATERIAL
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0136115_0136707 IF WE'RE GONNA USE SPONGY MATERIAL WE HAVE TO THINK OF HOW PRACTICAL IT IS AND HOW WE CAN FURTHER PROMOTE THAT IDEA
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0136707_0136880 AND ALSO THIS WAS THIS YEAR
AMI_ES2003c_H02_MEE012_0136947_0137563 SO THINGS CHANGE ALL THE TIME EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW THEY THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR THIS IS THE NEW BLACK

AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0039279_0039400 UH BUT
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0039624_0039873 UM IT REQUIRES A
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0039984_0040453 MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP TO USE AND IF YOU WANNA USE L. C. D. IT'S EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0040453_0040781 SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE THERE'S TRADE OFFS THERE

AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0053247_0053964 UH THE PREVIOUS SLIDES JUST EXPLAIN WHAT'S IN THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0053964_0054379 IF YOU GO TO THE ONE BEFORE THAT UH SO IT JUST SAYS WHAT IT DOES
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0054379_0054860 TRANSLATE THE KEY PRESS INTO AN INFRA RED SIGNAL AND THIS IS RECEIVED BY THE T. V.
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0054860_0055633 UH THE CHIP JUST NEEDS TO DETECT THE SIGNAL OR DETECT THE KEY PRESS AND THEN UH IT'LL SEND IT TO THE TR THE AMPLIFIER
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0055887_0056351 AND UH THEN THE NEXT SLIDE JUST SHOWS HOW THE UH COPPER WIRES

AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0057550_0057816 SO THAT'S JUST HOW THE CONTROL WORKS INSIDE
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0058049_0058197 UM WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHAT
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0058316_0058423 BUTTONS WE'RE GONNA USE
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0060532_0060591 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0060754_0061497 I THINK WE CAN DO IT IF UH WE USE CONVENTIONAL BATTERIES AND NOT HAVE SOLAR CELLS OR KINETIC
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0061497_0061734 UM AND THEN
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0061866_0062288 MAYBE USE SINGLE CURVED UH CASE
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0062394_0062644 BECAUSE WE MIGHT NEED IT TO BE CURVED FOR THE UH
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0062749_0063074 THUMB TO USE THE JOYST JOYSTICK EASILY
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0063074_0063116 UM
AMI_ES2003c_H03_MEE010_0063333_0063591 AND THEN YOU'LL NEED THE ADVANCED CHIP OBVIOUSLY FOR THE L. C. D.

AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0010011_0010034 NOW
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0010191_0010766 DO UH DOING THE PROTOTYPE GAVE US A BIT MORE INSIGHT INTO THE ERGONOMICS OF THE DESIGN
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0010766_0010996 UM FOR ONE THING
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0010996_0012226 IT TURNED OUT THAT THE ONLY POINT AT WHICH IT NEEDS TO BE ARTICULATED FOR HANDEDNESS IS UM IS H I IS DOWN HERE FOR THE UH L. E. D.
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0012226_0013337 AS IT TURNED OUT THE WHOLE THING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIGHT TO LEFT HAND FAIRLY WELL FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF OPERATING THE UH FUNCTION BUTTONS AND JOYSTICK
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0013337_0014086 THOUGH IT MIGHT BE AN IDEA TO BE ABLE TO A ADJUST THE POSITIONS FOR THE BASE OF THE JOYSTICK JUST A LITTLE BIT FOR UH
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0014203_0014450 JU JUST A THOUGHT
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0014450_0015163 YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE A SLIGHTLY OVOID SHAPED JOYSTICK THAT COULD THEN JUST BE TURN UH TWISTED ROUND
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0015163_0015850 SO THAT THE UH STICKY UH SO THAT THE BIT THAT STICKS OUT A BIT MORE IS ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0015850_0016311 BUT AS YOU AS YOU SEE WITH THE UH WITH HOLDING IT IN THE LEFT HAND
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0016311_0016901 THE L. UH THE L. C. D. IS NOWHERE USEFUL SO THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0017016_0017287 UH IF WE'RE GOING TO RETAIN ERGONOMIC DESIGN
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0017410_0018025 UM NOW I I GOT YOUR NOTE ABOUT UH KEEPING THE COST DOWN
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0018126_0018181 YEAH
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0018326_0018873 THIS DESIGN COULD BE DONE WITH UM

AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0019446_0019823 THOUGH I WOULD RECOMMEND AROUND THE GRIP PART HERE IN THE MIDDLE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0019823_0020595 HAVING MAYBE JUST A RUBBER GRIP OVER THAT WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR A SLIGHTLY MORE SORT OF BIO MORPHIC FORM AND A BIT MORE ERGONOMIC AS WELL
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0020595_0020750 AS FOR THE UM
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0020877_0021033 AS FOR THE SINGLE CURVE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0021149_0021951 UM WELL THIS EDGE AND THIS EDGE LIKE I SAY IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME CURVATURE TO IT BUT IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0021951_0022851 REALLY THE CURVE THAT'S MOST NEEDED IS THE UNDERSIDE SO THAT THE JO SO THAT THE JOYSTICK RESTS OVER THE THE EDGE OF THE HAND LIKE THIS
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0022965_0023107 UM AND YOU HAVE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0023258_0024076 THE UH TRANSMITTER HERE AND A WEE SPEAKER FOR THE UH FOR THE UH FOR THE UH FI UH FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL FINDER

AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0027218_0027541 ONE NICE WEE FEATURE IF WE COULD IF WE COULD STILL DO THE RUBBER
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0027541_0028508 I THOUGH OF WAS TO HAVE THE UH RUBBER EXTEND BEYOND THE END OF THE UH OF THE RIGID SUBSTRUCTURE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0028508_0028901 SO IT HAS A WEE SORT OF TAIL THAT YOU JUST DRAPE OVER YOUR WRIST SO IT STAYS IN POSITION NICELY

AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0131522_0132184 BECAUSE MOST M MOST REMOTES ARE A FAIRLY DINGY COLOUR THAT GETS CAMOUFLAGED UNDER ANY PILE OF CRAP IN A LIVING ROOM
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0132614_0132688 OR GREY
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0132858_0132922 YELLOW
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0134133_0134197 OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0137797_0137909 THREE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0137909_0138053 I THINK WE CAN DO THREE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0138087_0138437 TH THE SPECIAL COLOUR DOESN'T WOULD I THINK MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0138437_0139071 IT MAKES IT STAND OUT FROM YOU KNOW IT'S LOST IN A BIG PILE OF CRAP IT STANDS OUT FROM THE REST OF THE CRAP
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0139564_0139709 TWO BUTTONS AND A JOYSTICK
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0139860_0139913 TOTALLY
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0141877_0142094 IT DOESN'T GET MUCH FANCIER

AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0145897_0146001 YEAH
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0146001_0147180 I MEAN THE MENUS THING IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T NORMALLY SEE ON UM ON A REMOTE BUT YOU SEE IT IN A LOT OF OTHER PLACES
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0147986_0148042 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0148461_0148562 I'D GIVE IT A THREE

AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0153386_0153854 WELL I I I WOULD SA I WOULD SAY GIVE A S GIVE A SELECTION OF COLOURS
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0153854_0154301 UM WE WENT WITH YELLOW WE WENT WITH YELLOW FOR THE PROTOTYPE 'CAUSE WE HAD YELLOW
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0154301_0154565 IF I WERE BUYING ONE I'D GO FOR PURPLE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0154565_0154656 LEOPARD PRINT WOULD BE COOL
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0158002_0158080 THAT'S KINDA
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0158111_0158318 I IT WON'T BE WHEN IT'S BEEN
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0158506_0158590 BUDGETED
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0158972_0159548 I I THINK S I I THINK THIS ISN'T NOT PARTICULARLY FRUIT AND VEGGIE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0159548_0159601 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0161322_0161429 MM
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0161429_0161966 I'D I'D I DON'T THINK FRUIT AND VEG IS THE SOLE CRITERION
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0161966_0162676 IS THE SOLE CRITERION FOR BEING UM FASHION FASHIONABLE OR INSPIRED BY CURRENT FASHIONS
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0162676_0163165 UM I'D G I'D RATE I'D RATE THIS FAIRLY HIGHLY FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW ACTUALLY

AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0178948_0179206 I THINK GIVEN THAT
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0179322_0179587 THE PRODUCT UM
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0179866_0180318 ONLY REPLACES A SINGLE REMOTE CONTROL THAT YOU'VE ALREADY GOT
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0180512_0180950 ARE PEOPLE REALLY GONNA SHELL OUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR SOMETHING THAT'S ONLY MARGINALLY GOOD
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0189400_0189450 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0189450_0189920 I S I SUPPOSE ONE THING IS THAT B BECAUSE IT'S TECHNICALLY INNOVATIVE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0189999_0190766 UM FOR SOMEONE WHO'S SORT OF TECHNOPHOBIC THE FACT THAT IT SIMPLY LOOKS UNFAMILIAR WOULD BE DAUNTING
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0190941_0190977 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0196450_0196627 YEAH GOT NOTES AND DOODLES
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0197624_0197910 WELL I THINK THIS IS A I THINK THE DIGITAL PEN'S MOSTLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UH
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0198060_0198231 OF THE RESEARCHERS STUDYING THIS
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0198231_0198493 IT'S ALL P GOES INTO THEIR CORPUS
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0198493_0198814 THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFER THE UM
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0198945_0199222 TRANSFER OUR N OUR PAPER NOTES ONTO THE UH

AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0207632_0209134 I MEAN I TH I MEAN I THINK TO R RETAINING THE S THE MORE SORT OF BIO MORPHIC FORM IN THE ARTICULATION WOULD GAIN MORE IN S UH WOULD GAIN MORE PROFIT IN SALES THAN IT WOULD LOSE IN UH
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0209276_0209408 IN ADDED EXPENSE
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0213387_0213471 SUCH AS IT IS
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0219200_0221119 ACTUALLY I WANT TH ONE THING I WOULD SAY I MEAN SOMETHING THAT COULD PERHAPS BE PART OF THE PRODUCT MM THE UM M PRODUCT TESTING MARKET RESEARCH PROCESS WOULD BE TO UH PRODUCE MOCK UPS OF BOTH VERSIONS AND SEE JUST HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE THE OVER GOING OVER BUDGET
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0221232_0221398 UM M WOULD MAKE TO SALES
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0221853_0222173 AND WE COULD EVEN YOU KNOW MARKET TWO VERSIONS
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0222548_0222946 WEE CHEAPIE VERSION WITH THE NICE BIO MORPHIC RUBBER
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0223501_0223571 YES

AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0230440_0230477 OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H00_MEE011_0231164_0231209 THANK YOU
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0000004_0000311 THAT SHOULD HOPEFULLY DO THE TRICK UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0001698_0001743 'KAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0001743_0002027 SORRY ABOUT THE SMALL DELAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0002027_0002444 FALLING A LITTLE BIT BEHIND SCHEDULE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0002444_0002925 AND THAT'S UH FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0003424_0003504 OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0003504_0004121 SO JUST TO TRY AND ROUGHLY GO OVER WHAT WE AGREED IN THE LAST ONE UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0004328_0004708 WE'RE GONNA GO FOR SOMETHING UH UH HOW WAS IT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0004708_0004923 UH THE NEW BLACK I BELIEVE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0004923_0005839 UM SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD 'CAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE IN PREFERENCE TO ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY IN THE END THOUGH WE SHOULD NEVER AVOID FUNCTIONALITY OF COURSE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0005839_0006107 UH MANY OF OUR COMPONENTS ARE GONNA BE STANDARD OFF THE SHELF
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0006107_0006933 BUT IT SEEMED LIKE WE WERE GONNA REQUIRE AT LEAST AN ADVANCED CHIP AND WE WERE STILL VERY MUCH FOR THE IDEA OF USING AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0006933_0007572 UM OTHER THINGS WERE WE WERE HOPING TO USE RUBBER MOST LIKELY GONNA BE DOUBLE CURVED ETCETERA
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0007766_0007942 OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0007942_0008721 SO UM DUE TO YOUR HARD WORK WE MIGHT AS WELL LET THE UH TWO DESIGNERS GO FIRST AND UH SHOW US THE PROTOTYPE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0008922_0009241 QUITE HOW THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS I'M NOT SURE BUT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0014065_0014100 OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0018046_0018179 I'M AFRAID YEAH
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0018179_0018380 WE'LL GO INTO THAT A BIT MORE BUT PLEASE GO ON
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0026482_0026524 MM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0029806_0029862 OKAY YEAH
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0029862_0030011 GREAT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0030011_0030117 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0030420_0030668 YEAH OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0030668_0030770 EXCELLENT WORK
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0031288_0031447 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0044176_0044297 YEAH I BELIEVE SO
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0044297_0045009 SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COULD ACTUALLY STOP A REMOTE BEING LOST 'CAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE HUMAN ELEMENT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0045009_0045514 BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'VE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT FINDING THE DAMN THING ONCE WE HAVE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0051225_0051372 MM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0051372_0051408 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0051629_0052179 JUST BEFORE WE GO THROUGH ALL OF THE STEPS HERE UM WELL WHAT WE'LL DO IS
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0052409_0053089 UM IF WE CAN LOOK AT THE CRITERIA YOU'RE GONNA EVALUATE AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE PRODUCT EVALUATION IF THAT'S ALRIGHT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0053089_0053164 YEAH IS THAT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0053342_0053848 UM SO IS THERE ANYTHING HERE THAT YOU
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0054179_0054489 THAT YOU WANTED TO COVER AS IN THE CRITERIA THAT YOU'VE COVERED
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0054489_0054692 AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK PRETTY MUCH PROMPTLY TO THIS
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0054823_0055101 I IS THERE ANY OF THESE CRITERIA THAT NEED ANY EXPLAINING
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0055101_0055491 OR IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOUS THOUGHT THA REALLY WOULD STAND OUT COMPARED TO THE OTHERS
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0058866_0058913 OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0060654_0060758 OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0060758_0061005 NO AND WHICH WE WILL DO VERY VERY SHORTLY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0061299_0061472 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0061691_0061982 OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0061982_0062810 SLIGHT PROBLEM WE HAD WAS THAT WE HAVE AN AMAZING FOUR EUROS OVER BUDGET FOR WHAT WE WERE HOPING TO DO
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0062810_0063925 UM MOST OF IT STEMS FROM THE USE OF THE L. C. D. WHICH I THINK IN THE END ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF OUR EXPENDITURE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE REQUIRED A CHIP AS WELL
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0063925_0064508 UM THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS DOWN WAS EITHER TO DITCH THE A L. C. D.
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0064508_0065021 AT WHICH POINT WE'VE REMOVED A LARGE PART OF HOW WE WERE GONNA INTERFACE REQUIRE MORE BUTTONS ETCETERA
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0065208_0066052 OR WHAT WE DID WAS THAT WE UM WE AS IN I AS I WAS QUICKLY GOING OVER IT WAS ALTERING THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0066052_0067092 UM CHANGING IT TO PLASTIC AND A SOLID UNIT WITH A SINGLE CURVE DESIGN WOULD ALLOW US TO COME BACK INTO THE UM PROPOSED COSTS AND WE'RE JUST SCRAPING IT IN
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0067092_0067389 WE'VE GOT POINT TWO OF A EURO LEFT OVER THERE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0067389_0067648 SO WE'RE JUST MANAGING IT REALLY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0067648_0068346 EVEN THEN AS WELL UM THERE WAS NO CRITERIA TECHNICALLY DEFINED FOR A JOYSTICK SO I'VE USED WHAT I THINK'S APPROPRIATE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0068346_0068712 WITH ANY LUCK THAT WON'T MEAN THAT WE'VE INCURRED MORE COST THAN WE CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0068982_0069861 IT BLOWS A LOT OF OUR REALLY GOOD IDEAS KIND OF SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A U. S. B. CONNECTION IS DEFINITELY NOT VIABLE NOW
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0069861_0069940 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0070223_0070351 THAT SHOULD STILL BE VIABLE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0070351_0070595 WE'VE GOT AN ADVANCED CHIP WE'VE GOT THE USE OF THE L. C. D.
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0070595_0071179 SO BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES IS STILL VERY MUCH A POSSIBILITY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0071179_0071752 UM BUT WHAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO DECIDE ON IS HOW WE'RE GONNA GO FROM HERE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0071752_0072265 WE DO NEED TO TRY AND COME UP WITH AN IDEA WHICH COULD BE CONTINUED WITH OTHER PEOPLE IF NEED BE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0072265_0072333 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0072519_0072996 WE CAN I CAN BRING THE EXCEL UP SHEET UP AND UH SHOW YOU IF YOU WISH UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0072996_0073590 I REALLY THINK AS M MUCH AS IT PAINS ME IS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO WITH PLASTIC AND SOME KIND OF SOLID DESIGN
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0073590_0074103 POSSIBLY MEANING THAT THE L. C. D. WOULDN'T BE IN THIS PERFECT PLACE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0074103_0074624 IT MIGHT BE S STUCK LIKE SLIGHTLY BETWEEN WHAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR LEFT HANDED AND WHAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR A RIGHT HANDED PERSON
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0075749_0075792 OKAY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0076076_0076384 IT VERY MUCH IS ABOUT MAKING CONCESSIONS UNFORTUNATELY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0076384_0076424 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0077405_0077763 UM B B B DA IS YOU MEAN ON THE PLASTIC OR
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0077763_0077942 LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0077942_0078271 YOU NOW HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I DO
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0078271_0078338 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0078519_0078763 SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE FOR EXAMPLE THE BATTERY
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0078882_0079075 REALLY NOT VERY LITTLE CHOICE IN THAT ONE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0079075_0079305 WE'VE GONE FOR ONE OF THE CHEAPER OPTIONS AS WELL
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0079305_0079629 UNFORTUNATELY WE REQUIRE THE ADVANCED CHIP IF WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT WE'RE NEEDING TO
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0079765_0079901 I'VE SAID SINGLE CURVED
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0079901_0080273 WE REALLY DO NEED IT TO BE THAT WAY FOR THE ERGONOMICS OF IT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0080273_0080695 UM PLASTIC FOR SOME REASON INCURS NO COST WHICH I'VE HAD TO VERY MUCH MAKE ADVANTAGE OF
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0080695_0081145 DESPITE THE FACT THAT RUBBER'S ONLY GOT A VALUE OF TWO EUROS PER UNIT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0081145_0081463 PROBLEM COMES HERE AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE INTERFACE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0081463_0081501 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0081692_0082306 IF I'VE READ THIS THING CORRECTLY THEN WE CAN SAVE POINT FIVE OF A EURO HERE IN THAT IT'S NOT PER PUSH BUTTON
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0082306_0082747 THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THEN A NUMERIC KEYPAD WOULD COME IN AT UM WHAT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0082747_0083184 FOUR POINT FIVE EUROS WHICH IS AN AWFUL LOT SO THAT COULD WELL BE WRONG
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0083184_0083820 EVEN IF WE SAVE POINT FIVE THERE IT WOULD JUST MEAN THAT WE'RE MOST LIKELY PLACING IT IN ACTUALLY JUST GAINING A COLOUR FOR THE UNIT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0083820_0084027 WHICH HAS HAD TO BE PUT TO ONE SIDE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0084027_0084198 AS YOU CAN SEE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0084198_0085497 THE USE OF AN L. C. DISPLAY UM ADVANCED CHIP AND WHAT WOULD DETERMINE THE SCROLL WHEEL HERE AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S AN INTEGRATED SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON THAT WASN'T QUITE WHAT I THINK THEY HAD IN MIND WITH A JOYSTICK
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0086455_0086881 I THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP WITH THE BEAN COUNTERS
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0086881_0086963 UM
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0087120_0087503 AS YOU CAN SEE I MEAN THAT'S TAKEN UP WELL OVER HALF OF THE PRICE
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0087503_0087906 SO UM I'M VERY MUCH OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS OF WHERE WE GO
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0087906_0089030 BUT BECAUSE WE NEED TO SHED WHAT WAS FOUR EUROS OFF OF THE UM THE PRICE OF FOR WHAT WE REALLY DESIRED
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0089030_0089942 THIS ONE COMES IN UNDER PRICE AS YOU CAN SEE BUT THIS WAS THE ONE THAT SACRIFICED THE MATERIAL FOR THE CASE AND FOR THE ACTUAL CASE DESIGN
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0090873_0091227 UH NO WE HAVEN'T NOT
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0091973_0092270 THAT'LL IT LITERALLY WOULD JUST BE A BUTTON
AMI_ES2003d_H01_MEE009_0092270_0092388 WE MIGHT HAVE TO
