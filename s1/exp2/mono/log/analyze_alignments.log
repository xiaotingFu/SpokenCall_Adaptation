The optional-silence phone sil occupies 28.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 79.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 19.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 10.9 hours of data, or 7.8 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (25,35.7,98)
