1. sharedTask                         # includes the training data    
               -all                   # includes 5222 utterances shared task development set
               -st_ihm20_psgAll       # mixed traing data, each include 20% of AMI + PF-STAR_German + ST data
                     -train10         # 20% of AMI + PF-STAR_German + 100% of ST data      
               -utt_ids               # utt ids for different ST subset, we use this to separate data to do 10-fold cross-validation.
We need sharedTask/st_ihm20_psgAll/train10 and sharedTask/all to train the JJJ system.
