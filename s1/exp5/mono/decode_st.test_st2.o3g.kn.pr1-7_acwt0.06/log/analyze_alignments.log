The optional-silence phone sil occupies 60.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 50.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 22.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.9 hours of data, or 0.4 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 6.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (24,38.1,127)
