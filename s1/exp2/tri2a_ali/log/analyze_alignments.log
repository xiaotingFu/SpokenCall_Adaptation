The optional-silence phone sil occupies 27.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 78.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 18.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 88.7 hours of data, or 64.6 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 6.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (17,28.7,91)
